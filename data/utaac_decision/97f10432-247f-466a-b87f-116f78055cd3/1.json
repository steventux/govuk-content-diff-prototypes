This is an appeal, brought by the claimant, against a decision of the First-tier\r\nTribunal dated 10 July 2015 whereby it dismissed the claimant’s appeal against a\r\ndecision of the Secretary of State dated 7 November 2014, as revised on 19 January\r\n2015, to the effect that the claimant’s award of disability living allowance (“DLA”)\r\ncomprised of the lower rate of the mobility component and the lowest rate of the care\r\ncomponent terminated on 9 December 2014 and she was entitled to personal\r\nindependence payment (“PIP”) comprised of the enhanced rate of the daily living\r\ncomponent from 10 December 2014. The appeal raises an important issue as to the\r\nlegality of the Personal Independence Payment (Transitional Provisions)\r\nRegulations 2013 (SI 2013/387) (the “Transitional Regulations”).\r\nBackground\r\n2. Part 4 of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 (i.e., sections 77 to 95) introduces PIP\r\nand provides for the abolition of DLA which is payable under the Social Security\r\nContributions and Benefits Act 1992. The benefits are both payable to those with\r\nlong-term disabilities and the intention is obviously that PIP will replace DLA. There\r\nare structural similarities between the benefits, but also major differences in the tests\r\nfor entitlement.\r\n3. Entitlement to both benefits is generally subject to the relevant level of\r\ndisablement having been present for at least three months and to it being expected\r\nto last for a lengthy period – six months in the case of DLA and nine months in the\r\ncase of PIP. Both benefits are subject to the requirement in section 1 of the Social\r\nSecurity Administration Act 1992 that there has been a claim and the benefits are\r\nalso both subject to the same adjudication regime under the Social Security Act\r\n1998. There is no provision for backdating a claim for either benefit. Thus there is\r\nno entitlement before the date of the claim and both an initial claim and an\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 2\r\napplication for supersession under section 10 of the 1998 Act on the ground of\r\nchange of circumstances are, subject to the three-month qualifying period, generally\r\neffective from the date of claim or of the application for supersession as the case\r\nmay be, whereas an adverse supersession is generally effective either from the date\r\nof supersession or, if the claimant could reasonably have been expected to disclose\r\nthe change of circumstances earlier, from the date of the change. The mere\r\nprovision of information often implies an application for supersession and so the\r\nlegislation applicable in respect of each benefit expressly provides that notification of\r\na change of circumstances may be treated as such an application.\r\n4. Each benefit consists of two components, a care component and a mobility\r\ncomponent in the case of DLA and a daily living component and a mobility\r\ncomponent in the case of PIP. The care component of DLA is payable at three rates\r\nbut the mobility component of DLA and both components of PIP are payable at two\r\nrates. The daily living component of PIP is paid at the same rates as the two highest\r\nrates of the care component (£81.30 pw and £54.45 pw at the material time in 2014)\r\nand the mobility component rates are the same for both benefits (£56.75 pw and\r\n£21.55 pw at the material time). The lowest rate of the care component of DLA\r\n(£21.55 pw at the material time) is therefore effectively being abolished. Moreover,\r\nthe grounds upon which a claimant may be entitled to either component of PIP are\r\nwholly different from the conditions for entitlement to either component of DLA.\r\n5. The proposal to replace DLA with PIP was originally taken by the Government\r\nin 2010. At that time, there were 3.2 million recipients of DLA, of whom 1.8 million\r\nwere aged at least 16 but under 65, and thus regarded in the Government’s\r\nterminology as of “working age”, a number then expected to increase to 2.2 million\r\nby 2016/17. One reason given by the Government for the introduction PIP is that it\r\nis intended to be better focused on the more seriously disabled than DLA, but it is\r\nalso an avowed purpose of the new scheme that it should reduce public expenditure.\r\nIt was expected that the number of claimants would be reduced and that\r\n£2,240,000,000 pa would be saved once those of working age were transferred to\r\nthe PIP régime.\r\n6. Plainly it would have been impractical to introduce PIP and abolish DLA for all\r\nclaimants of working age at the same time when each claimant would need a new\r\nindividual assessment of his or her entitlement to the new benefit. Accordingly, the\r\nnew legislation is being brought into force gradually. Section 150 of the 2012 Act\r\nprovides for Part 4 to be brought into force by commencement order and further\r\nprovides that such an order may appoint different days for different purposes and\r\ndifferent days for different areas. Most of the provisions in the 2012 Act relating to\r\nPIP were brought into force in parts of the North of England from 8 April 2013 and\r\nthey were brought into force for the rest of Great Britain from 10 June 2013, subject\r\nin both cases to provision made by the Transitional Regulations, through which the\r\nprocess of transferring claimants from DLA to PIP is being managed.\r\nThe Transitional Regulations\r\n7. Section 93 of the 2012 Act provides –\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 3\r\n“93.–(1) Regulations may make such provision as the Secretary of State considers\r\nnecessary or expedient in connection with the coming into force of any provision of\r\nthis Part.\r\n(2) Schedule 10 (transitional provision for introduction of personal independence\r\npayment) has effect.”\r\nParagraph 1(1) of Schedule 10 provides that –\r\n“Regulations under section 93 may in particular make provision for the purposes of,\r\nor in connection with, replacing disability living allowance with personal\r\nindependence payment.”\r\nParagraphs 2 to 4 of the Schedule provide that such provision includes a number of\r\nspecified matters. It is not necessary to set them out and neither is it necessary to\r\nset out section 94 which makes provision as to the way that regulation-making\r\npowers in Part 4 of the Act must, or may, be exercised.\r\n8. The Transitional Regulations have the effect that those who were aged 65 or\r\nover on 8 April 2013 cannot claim PIP and neither can any person who is under 16.\r\nThey also have the effect that no-one who is entitled to claim PIP may claim DLA,\r\nalthough until 27 October 2013 there was an exception for those with fixed-term\r\nawards of DLA which were due to expire before the end of February 2014.\r\n9. From 28 October 2013, the process began of transferring those of working\r\nage entitled to DLA to the PIP régime. This is generally achieved by inviting the\r\nperson entitled to DLA (known as a “DLA entitled person”) to claim PIP and then\r\nterminating the award of DLA either when the claim for PIP is determined or after\r\nthey have failed to claim PIP despite having been given a further opportunity to do.\r\n10. Regulation 3 of the Transitional Regulations provided at the material time –\r\n“Invitations to persons entitled to disability living allowance to claim personal\r\nindependence payment\r\n3.—(1) At any time after 27th October 2013, the Secretary of State may by written\r\nnotification invite a DLA entitled person to make a claim for personal independence\r\npayment.\r\n(2) The Secretary of State must not send a notification under paragraph (1) to any\r\nperson who, on 8th April 2013, was 65 or over.\r\n(3) Subject to paragraphs (3A) and (4), the Secretary of State must send a\r\nnotification under paragraph (1) to a DLA entitled person who reaches 16 after 27th\r\nOctober 2013 as soon as reasonably practicable after the person reaches that age.\r\n(3A) …\r\n(4) …\r\n(5) Subject to paragraph (5A), where, after 27th October 2013, a DLA entitled\r\nperson who has neither—\r\n(a) been sent a notification under paragraph (1), nor\r\n(b) made a claim for personal independence payment under regulation 4,\r\nnotifies the Secretary of State of a change of circumstances other than a change to\r\nwhich paragraph (6) applies, the Secretary of State must, as soon as reasonably\r\npracticable, send the person a notification under paragraph (1).\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 4\r\n(5A) Paragraph (5) does not apply unless—\r\n(a) the Secretary of State has specified a relevant date which applies in the case\r\nof the DLA entitled person, and\r\n(b) that person notifies the Secretary of State of the change of circumstances on\r\nor after that relevant date.\r\n(6) This paragraph applies to a change of circumstances where the change notified\r\nis that the DLA entitled person is to become or has become absent, whether\r\ntemporarily or permanently, from Great Britain.”\r\nThe terms “change of circumstances” which appears in regulation 3(5) and “relevant\r\ndate” which appears in regulation 3(5A) are defined in regulation 2(1) –\r\n““change of circumstances” means a change of circumstances which a person might\r\nreasonably have been expected to know might affect the continuance of that\r\nperson's entitlement to disability living allowance (by ending entitlement to one\r\ncomponent or both components or resulting in entitlement to one or both\r\ncomponents being at a different rate);”\r\n““relevant date” means the date, specified by the Secretary of State in relation to any\r\ncategory of DLA entitled person, from which the Secretary of State is satisfied that\r\nsatisfactory arrangements will be in place to assess the entitlement of persons in\r\nthat category to personal independence payment”.\r\n11. As the reference in regulation 3(5)(b) to “a claim for personal independence\r\npayment under regulation 4” suggests, a DLA entitled person aged at least 16 but\r\nunder 65 may make a claim for PIP voluntarily without being invited to do so under\r\nregulation 3(1). Such a person is, by virtue of regulation 2(1), known as “a voluntary\r\ntransfer claimant”. The term “transfer claimant” refers both to a person who has\r\nmade a claim in response to a notification under regulation 3(1) and to a voluntary\r\ntransfer claimant.\r\n12. At the material time, regulation 17 provided –\r\n“Procedure following and consequences of determination of claim for personal\r\nindependence payment\r\n17.—(1) Upon an assessment determination being made on a claim by a transfer\r\nclaimant—\r\n(a) the Secretary of State must, as soon as practicable, send the claimant\r\nwritten notification of the outcome of the determination, and\r\n(b) the claimant’s entitlement to disability living allowance shall terminate, …, on\r\nthe last day of the period of 28 days starting with the first pay day after the\r\nmaking of the determination.\r\n(2) Where the outcome of an assessment determination is an award in respect of\r\neither or both components of personal independence payment, the claimant’s\r\nentitlement to personal independence payment starts with effect from the day\r\nimmediately following—\r\n(a) the day referred to in paragraph (1)(b), or\r\n(b) ….\r\n(3) The notification referred to in paragraph (1) must state—\r\n(a) …, the day on which the claimant’s entitlement to disability living allowance\r\nwill terminate in accordance with paragraph (1)(b), and\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 5\r\n(b) if personal independence payment is awarded, the day on which the\r\nclaimant’s entitlement to personal independence payment starts in\r\naccordance with paragraph (2).\r\n(4) This paragraph applies to a person—\r\n(a) whose claim for disability living allowance was refused,\r\n(b) who claimed personal independence payment after that refusal, and\r\n(c) who, as a result of the determination of legal proceedings initiated under the\r\n1998 Act in relation to that refusal, becomes entitled, after the assessment\r\ndetermination, to disability living allowance.\r\n(5) The entitlement of a person to whom paragraph (4) applies to disability living\r\nallowance shall terminate—\r\n(a) where personal independence payment is awarded, on the day before that\r\non which the person becomes entitled to personal independence payment,\r\nand\r\n(b) where personal independence payment is not awarded, on the last day of the\r\nperiod of 28 days starting with the first pay day after the making of the\r\nassessment determination.”\r\n13. Regulation 20 provided –\r\n“Notifications of change of circumstances\r\n20.—(1) This regulation applies where—\r\n(a) a person notifies the Secretary of State of a change of circumstances, and\r\n(b) paragraph (3), (4) or (5) applies.\r\n(2) If this regulation applies—\r\n(a) the notification shall not be regarded as relating to disability living allowance\r\nand accordingly neither section 10 (decisions superseding earlier decisions)\r\nnor any other provision of the 1998 Act shall apply, and\r\n(b) the notification to the Secretary of State must be treated in all respects as if it\r\nwere a notification under paragraph (4) of regulation 38 (evidence and\r\ninformation in connection with an award) of the Claims and Payments\r\nregulations of a change of circumstances which the person might reasonably\r\nbe expected to know might affect the continuance of entitlement to personal\r\nindependence payment.\r\n(3) This paragraph applies where a notified person notifies the Secretary of State\r\nof a change of circumstances before the person makes a claim for personal\r\nindependence payment.\r\n(4) This paragraph applies where a transfer claimant notifies the Secretary of State\r\nof a change of circumstances.\r\n(5) This paragraph applies where a DLA entitled person notifies the Secretary of\r\nState of a change of circumstances and, as a result, the Secretary of State is\r\nrequired by regulation 3(5) to send a notification under regulation 3(1) inviting the\r\nperson to claim personal independence payment.\r\n(6) Paragraphs (3) and (4) do not apply where the change of circumstances notified\r\nis that the notified person or the transfer claimant, as the case may be, is to become\r\nor has become absent, whether temporarily or permanently, from Great Britain.”\r\nThe facts of this case\r\n14. The claimant suffers from depression, agoraphobia, hypertension and also\r\nsome restriction in the movement of three fingers of her right hand as the result of an\r\naccident. It is not clear when she was first awarded DLA but she certainly had an\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 6\r\naward of the lowest rate of the care component and the lower rate of the mobility\r\ncomponent from 8 January 2012. It is stated in the Secretary of State’s submission\r\nto the First-tier Tribunal that she notified the Secretary of State of a change of\r\ncircumstances and was therefore invited to claim PIP, which she did by telephone on\r\n15 May 2014. The Secretary of State has no record of what information the claimant\r\nprovided when notifying the change of circumstances but the claimant’s\r\nrepresentative before the First-tier Tribunal, Mr Nisar Ali, a welfare rights officer of\r\nSandwell Metropolitan Borough Council, stated that she had applied for\r\nsupersession of her award of DLA because her condition had deteriorated. The\r\nclaimant was asked to complete a PIP2 form, which was received by the Secretary of\r\nState on 2 June 2014. The only document relating to DLA he provided to the health\r\ncare professional was a factual report from the claimant’s GP dating from when she\r\nhad made a claim for DLA in 2006. A face-to-face consultation with the health care\r\nprofessional took place at the claimant’s home on 18 September 2014. In the light of\r\nthe health care professional’s advice, the Secretary of State notified the claimant on\r\n11 November 2014 that she was not entitled to PIP and that her award of DLA would\r\nterminate on 9 December 2014.\r\n15. With the support of her GP, the claimant asked for what the Secretary of State\r\ncalls “reconsideration” but, at least in this case, was technically revision under\r\nsection 9 of the 1998 Act. On 20 January 2015, the Secretary of State informed the\r\nclaimant that she was entitled to the enhanced rate of the daily living component of\r\nPIP from 10 December 2014 but was not entitled to the mobility component.\r\n16. With the support of Mr Ali, the claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal\r\nunder section 12 of the 1998 Act on the ground that the award should have been\r\neffective from the date of claim on 15 May 2014. The Secretary of State resisted the\r\nappeal on the ground that the award was rightly made from 10 December 2014\r\nunder regulation 17(2) of the Transitional Regulations. Mr Ali replied to the effect\r\nthat the legislation was discriminatory in breach of Article 14 of the European\r\nConvention of Human Rights, taken with Article 1 of Protocol 1. The First-tier\r\nTribunal dismissed the claimant’s appeal, stating that she “suffered no hardship, as\r\nshe moved from DLA to PIP without enduring any loss of payment for the entire\r\nperiod”.\r\n17. The First-tier Tribunal therefore seems to have been under a\r\nmisapprehension as to the nature of the claimant’s case. She had been entitled to\r\nonly £43.10 pw while in receipt of DLA but was entitled to £81.30 pw PIP. The\r\ndifference was £38.20 pw, amounting to some £1,100 in total over the period of\r\nalmost 30 weeks in issue, quite apart from the impact there would have been on her\r\nentitlement to income-related employment and support allowance during that period.\r\nThe claimant’s complaint was that, whereas generally a claimant making a claim or\r\napplying for a supersession would be awarded the appropriate benefit from the date\r\nof the claim or application, as a DLA entitled person subject to the Transitional\r\nRegulations, she was treated less favourably and deprived of a significant amount of\r\nmoney. In any event, the claimant now appeals, with permission granted by Upper\r\nTribunal Judge Rowland following an oral hearing and a further round of written\r\nsubmissions in the course of which the parties’ main arguments have been refined.\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 7\r\nThe meaning and effect of regulation 20(2)(b)\r\n18. Before turning to those arguments, it is necessary to consider an issue as to\r\nthe construction of the Transitional Regulations that arose during the course of the\r\nhearing before us as a result of the Chamber President asking what regulation\r\n20(2)(b) of the Transitional Regulations meant and what its purpose was. It is the\r\nSecretary of State’s case that the Transitional Regulations have the effect, in the\r\ncircumstances of this case, (a) that the claimant’s notification of the change in her\r\ncircumstances was, by virtue of regulation 20(2)(a) and (5), not treated as an\r\napplication for supersession of the award of DLA as it otherwise would have been,\r\n(b) that it led to her being invited under regulation 3(5) to make a claim for PIP and\r\n(c) that, following the determination of the claim, the award of DLA terminated in\r\naccordance with regulation 17(1)(b) and the award of PIP started on the following\r\nday by virtue of regulation 17(2)(a). Until the hearing, that approach to the\r\nconstruction of the Regulations was not challenged by the claimant. At first sight,\r\ntherefore, regulation 20(2)(b) merely has the effect that the notification of the change\r\nof circumstances which is not to be taken into account in relation to DLA should\r\ninstead be taken into account in the determination of the claim for PIP. However, as\r\nthe Secretary of State conceded, it is not obviously necessary to have a provision to\r\nthat effect and the reference to regulation 38 of the Universal Credit, Personal\r\nIndependence Payment, Jobseeker's Allowance and Employment and Support\r\nAllowance (Claims and Payments) Regulations 2013 (SI 2013/380) seems a little\r\nodd if that is the only effect intended.\r\n19. Regulation 38 of the Claims and Payments Regulations provides –\r\n“Evidence and information in connection with an award\r\n38.—(1) This regulation, apart from paragraph (7), applies to any person entitled to\r\nbenefit, other than a jobseeker's allowance, and any other person by whom, or on\r\nwhose behalf, payments by way of such a benefit are receivable.\r\n(2) ….\r\n(3) ….\r\n(4) A person to whom this regulation applies must notify the Secretary of State of\r\nany change of circumstances which the person might reasonably be expected to\r\nknow might affect—\r\n(a) the continuance of entitlement to benefit;\r\n(b) the amount of benefit awarded; or\r\n(c) the payment of benefit,\r\nas soon as reasonably practicable after the change occurs.\r\n(5) A notification of any change of circumstances under paragraph (4) must be\r\ngiven—\r\n(a) in writing or by telephone (unless the Secretary of State determines in any\r\ncase that notice must be given in a particular way or to accept notice given\r\notherwise than in writing or by telephone); or\r\n(b) in writing if in any class of case the Secretary of State requires written notice\r\n(unless the Secretary of State determines in any case to accept notice given\r\notherwise than in writing),\r\nand must be sent or delivered to, or received at, the appropriate office.\r\n…”\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 8\r\n20. The point having been raised, Dr Strothers submitted that it was necessary to\r\ngive regulation 20(2)(b) of the Transitional Regulations some effective meaning and\r\nthat the reference to regulation 38 of the Claims and Payments Regulations shows\r\nthat what the Transitional Regulations do is treat the DLA award as a PIP award so\r\nthat the application for supersession takes effect as such and regulation 17, which\r\napplies only to claims, does not apply. The result is that, if favourable to the\r\nclaimant, the decision on the supersession takes effect from the date of the\r\napplication by virtue of section 10(5) of the 1998 Act as such applications normally\r\ndo.\r\n21. Ingenious as that argument is, we do not accept it. The reference to\r\nregulation 3(5) in paragraph (5) of regulation 20 (which Dr Strothers rightly\r\nsuggested ought logically to precede paragraphs (3) and (4)) shows that the\r\ndraftsman was well aware of the relationship between the two regulations and, if the\r\ndraftsman had intended the approach suggested by Dr Strothers, he or she would\r\nhave qualified regulation 3(5) and not required a person who, by notifying a change\r\nof circumstances, was implicitly applying for a supersession to make a claim to which\r\nregulation 17 would apply. In any event, we can see no reason why the draftsman\r\nshould have wished to create such a complicated device, when altering the date\r\nfrom which an award was effective on a claim triggered by a notification of a change\r\nof circumstances in certain cases would have been so much simpler had he or she\r\nwished to ensure that such a claim took effect from the date of claim. In our\r\njudgment, the Transitional Regulations have the effect contended for by the\r\nSecretary of State, unless they are partly to be disapplied in the light of the\r\narguments considered below.\r\n22. We remain uncertain as to the thinking behind regulation 20(2)(b) but, to the\r\nextent that the language echoes that of the definition of “change of circumstances” in\r\nregulation 2(1), it may simply have been for the purpose of ensuring that the\r\ninformation was regarded as having been provided for PIP purposes even though\r\noriginally provided for DLA purposes, unnecessary as such an express provision\r\nmight have been. In particular, old medical reports supplied in connection with a\r\nclaim for DLA may be considered relevant and taken into account on a claim for PIP,\r\nas was done in this case, and regulation 20(2)(b) may be intended to ensure that,\r\nwhere such material is taken into account, a claimant is not penalised by way of a\r\ncivil penalty or prosecution if he or she does not include in the PIP claim form\r\ninformation given when notifying at the times covered by paragraphs (3) to (5) a\r\nrelevant change of circumstances that has occurred since the medical report was\r\nwritten.\r\n23. Whatever the exact purpose of the provision, we observe that it is likely to be\r\nundermined if, as in this case, the Secretary of State does not keep a record of the\r\ninformation provided as to the change of circumstances.\r\nThe main arguments in summary\r\n24. The claimant’s principal argument, advanced on her behalf primarily by Mr\r\nMcGurk, is that the Transitional Regulations result in discrimination that is unlawful\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 9\r\nby virtue of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, taken with\r\nArticle 1 of Protocol 1. Article 14 provides –\r\n“The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be\r\nsecured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language,\r\nreligion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national\r\nminority, property, birth or other status.”\r\n25. The difference in treatment that gives rise to the complaint of discrimination\r\narises from regulation 17(2) which has the effect that a claim for PIP made by a\r\nperson who is entitled to DLA is effective from a date some weeks after it is made,\r\nwhereas a claim for PIP made by anyone else is generally effective from the date of\r\nclaim and an application for supersession of an award of DLA is also generally\r\neffective from the date of the application.\r\n26. It is now accepted by the claimant that regulation 17(2) works to the\r\nadvantage of those claimants of DLA whose entitlement to PIP is less than their\r\nentitlement to DLA (“PIP losers”) or whose entitlement to PIP is the same as their\r\nentitlement to DLA (“PIP neutrals”). Those who are disadvantaged are those who,\r\nlike the claimant, are entitled to a greater amount of PIP than their former entitlement\r\nto DLA (“PIP winners”). The claimant also accepts that, if regulation 17(2) were to\r\nbe disapplied in any case, it would be necessary also to disapply regulation 17(1)(b)\r\nand terminate the award of DLA from the day before the PIP award became\r\neffective, so that arrears of PIP would be reduced by the amount of DLA paid before\r\nthe PIP award was implemented.\r\n27. The claimant therefore advances her primary argument on discrimination by\r\nreference to all PIP winners and compares them to successful new PIP claimants.\r\n28. An alternative argument on discrimination is advanced by the clamant by\r\nreference to a narrower class of PIP winners (the “Narrower Class” of PIP winners),\r\nnamely those PIP winners who, not only claimed PIP following an invitation issued\r\nas a result of having notified the Secretary of State of a change of circumstances\r\nrelating to their awards of DLA (see regulation 3(5)), but also would have been\r\nawarded more DLA had their awards been superseded in the light of the change of\r\ncircumstances. The claimant submits that, had she been assessed for DLA when\r\nshe claimed PIP, she would have secured entitlement to the middle rate of the care\r\ncomponent instead of the lowest rate, an increase of £32.90 pw. This is not much\r\nless than the £38.20 pw that she has lost on her primary case. The Secretary of\r\nState does not concede that the claimant would have qualified for the middle rate of\r\nthe care component, but he accepts that it is possible that she would have done so\r\nin the light of his findings when PIP was awarded and so that it is possible that she is\r\nin the Narrower Class of PIP winners.\r\n29. In respect of both of the claimant’s discrimination arguments, the Secretary of\r\nState accepts that the case falls within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol 1 but\r\nsubmits that the difference of treatment is not contrary to Article 14 for two reasons.\r\nFirst, he submits that it is not on the ground of “status” and secondly he submits that\r\nit is anyway justified.\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 10\r\n30. As a further argument in respect of the Narrower Class of PIP winners, the\r\nclaimant submits that the Transitional Regulations are ultra vires to the extent that\r\nthe combined effect of regulation 17(2) and regulation 20(2)(a) is that a claimant\r\nentitled to DLA whose disablement has got worse is unable during the time taken to\r\nmake a PIP assessment to secure the amount of benefit appropriate to his or her\r\nneeds under either the DLA régime by way of supersession for change of\r\ncircumstances of the DLA decision or the PIP régime. This is a rationality argument.\r\nIt is submitted that the effect of the legislation goes further than is permitted by\r\nsection 93(1) of the 2012 Act, as it could not rationally be regarded as either\r\nnecessary or expedient in connection with the coming into force of the provisions of\r\nPart 4 of that Act.\r\n31. The Secretary of State argues that he was entitled to regard the Transitional\r\nRegulations as necessary and expedient, advancing much the same arguments as\r\nhe advances for justifying the difference in treatment in relation to the discrimination\r\nclaim.\r\n32. There is also a substantial dispute between the parties as to whether the\r\nUpper Tribunal can give effective relief in this case even if the claimant succeeds in\r\nshowing that the Regulations give rise to unlawful discrimination or are otherwise\r\nultra vires. Had the claimant succeeded as regards either of those other issues, we\r\nwould have sought further argument on the question of remedy.\r\nDiscrimination – the proper approach to the questions of status and comparators\r\n33. The first issue argued before us was whether the difference of treatment\r\nbetween DLA entitled PIP winners and successful claimants of PIP who were not\r\npreviously entitled to DLA was on a ground outlawed by article 14. The Secretary of\r\nState makes the simple point that if both the claimant and the comparator are equally\r\ndisabled, the ground upon which they are treated differently cannot be disability.\r\nThe claimant, on the other hand, refers to Mathieson v Secretary of State for Work\r\nand Pension [2015] UKSC 47 and argues that it does not matter that the comparator\r\nis also disabled; the relevant status is still being a disabled person.\r\n34. Mathieson was decided against the background of earlier cases of which\r\nthree are of particular significance. In AL (Serbia) v Secretary of State for the Home\r\nDepartment [2008] UKHL 42; [2008] 1 WLR 1434 at [21] et seq., Baroness Hale of\r\nRichmond, with whom the other members of the House agreed, identified “[s]everal\r\nimportant points” about Article 14. First, it is different from the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment to the United States’ constitution because it applies only to matters\r\nwithin the ambit of the Convention, a point that is not in issue in the present case.\r\nSecondly, it is also different from United Kingdom anti-discrimination laws and, in\r\nparticular –\r\n“24. … the Classic Strasbourg statements of law do not place any emphasis on\r\nthe identification of an exact comparator. They ask whether ‘differences in\r\notherwise similar situations justify a different treatment’. …”\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 11\r\nShe continued –\r\n26. Thirdly, of course, the difference of treatment has to be on a prohibited\r\nground. Article 14 does not purport to challenge all possible classifications and\r\ndistinctions made by the law or government policy. The list of prohibited grounds is\r\nlong and open-ended, but it must be there for a purpose and cannot therefore be\r\nendless: see R (S) v Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police Force [2004] 1\r\nWLR 2196; and further in R (Clift) v Secretary of State for the Home Department\r\n[2007] 1 AC 484. In general, the list concentrates on personal characteristics which\r\nthe complainant did not choose and either cannot or should not be expected to\r\nchange. …”\r\n35. In R (RJM) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2008] UKHL 63;\r\n[2009] 1 AC 311, the House of Lords built upon the foundations laid by Lady Hale.\r\nThe leading speech was given by Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury but he and the\r\nother members of the House also agreed with additional observations made by Lord\r\nWalker of Gestingthorpe –\r\n“5. The other point on which I would comment is the expression \"personal\r\ncharacteristics\" used by the European Court of Human Rights in Kjeldsen, Busk,\r\nMadsen and Pedersen v Denmark (1976) 1 EHRR 711, and repeated in some later\r\ncases. \"Personal characteristics\" is not a precise expression and to my mind a binary\r\napproach to its meaning is unhelpful. \"Personal characteristics\" are more like a\r\nseries of concentric circles. The most personal characteristics are those which are\r\ninnate, largely immutable, and closely connected with an individual's personality:\r\ngender, sexual orientation, pigmentation of skin, hair and eyes, congenital\r\ndisabilities. Nationality, language, religion and politics may be almost innate\r\n(depending on a person's family circumstances at birth) or may be acquired (though\r\nsome religions do not countenance either apostates or converts); but all are\r\nregarded as important to the development of an individual's personality (they reflect,\r\nit might be said, important values protected by articles 8, 9 and 10 of the\r\nConvention). Other acquired characteristics are further out in the concentric circles;\r\nthey are more concerned with what people do, or with what happens to them, than\r\nwith who they are; but they may still come within article 14 (Lord Neuberger\r\ninstances military status, residence or domicile, and past employment in the KGB).\r\nLike him, I would include homelessness as falling within that range, whether or not it\r\nis regarded as a matter of choice (it is often the culmination of a series of\r\nmisfortunes that overwhelm an individual so that he or she can no longer cope). The\r\nmore peripheral or debateable any suggested personal characteristic is, the less\r\nlikely it is to come within the most sensitive area where discrimination is particularly\r\ndifficult to justify. There is an illuminating discussion of these points (contrasting\r\nStrasbourg jurisprudence with the American approach to the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment) in the speech of Baroness Hale of Richmond in A L (Serbia) v\r\nSecretary of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 42, [2008] 1 WLR 1434,\r\nparas 20-35.”\r\n36. In Clift, mentioned by Lady Hale in AL (Serbia), Lord Bingham of Cornhill had\r\nsaid in the House of Lords –\r\n“I do not think that a personal characteristic can be defined by the differential\r\ntreatment of which a person complains. But here Mr Clift does not complain of the\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 12\r\nsentence passed upon him, but of being denied a definitive Parole Board\r\nrecommendation. Is his classification as a prisoner serving a determinate sentence\r\nof 15 years or more (but less than life) a personal characteristic? I find it difficult to\r\napply so elusive a test. But I would incline to regard a life sentence as an acquired\r\npersonal characteristic and a lifer as having an \"other status\", and it is hard to see\r\nwhy the classification of Mr Clift, based on the length of his sentence and not the\r\nnature of his offences, should be differently regarded.”\r\n37. Nonetheless he had declined to find in favour of Mr Clift on the ground that\r\nthe idea that a personal characteristic could be acquired had not been explicitly or\r\nimpliedly authorised by the Strasbourg jurisprudence. Mr Clift took his case to the\r\nEuropean Court of Human Rights. In Clift v United Kingdom (application No\r\n7205/07), the Court decided in his favour, saying –\r\n“59. The Court therefore considers it clear that while it has consistently referred to\r\nthe need for a distinction based on a “personal” characteristic in order to engage\r\nArticle 14, as the above review of its case-law demonstrates, the protection\r\nconferred by that Article is not limited to different treatment based on characteristics\r\nwhich are personal in the sense that they are innate or inherent. Accordingly, even\r\nif, as the Government contended, a ejusdem generis construction were appropriate\r\nin the present case, this would not necessarily preclude the distinction upon which\r\nthe applicant relies.\r\n60. … The question whether there is a difference of treatment based on a\r\npersonal or identifiable characteristic … is … to be assessed taking into\r\nconsideration all of the circumstances of the case and bearing in mind that the aim\r\nof the Convention is to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights\r\nthat are practical and effective …” (our emphasis)\r\n38. This expansion in the understanding of the phrase “personal characteristic”\r\nsuggests that it is probably unhelpful to place too much weight on the use of the\r\nword “status” in the English version of the Convention. Moreover, the words “such\r\nas” precede “or other status” as well as the specific examples listed in Article 14 and,\r\nas has been noted in many of the cases, in the French version the words are “ou\r\ntoute autre situation”. These considerations in our view accord with Baroness Hale’s\r\ndescription of the list as open-ended, and it seems likely that she had an ejusdem\r\ngeneris construction in mind when she said that it was not endless.\r\n39. This all leads to the question, which Lord Neuberger left open in RJM at [41],\r\n“whether, and if so when, it may be appropriate in some cases not to consider the\r\n‘status’ issue as an entirely self-contained question”. Is it better, as Baroness Hale\r\nappears to suggest, to consider justification first on the basis that, if there appears to\r\nbe no satisfactory justification for a difference of treatment, it will become clear\r\nwhether the lack of justification is due to the difference being based on a personal\r\ncharacteristic or status?\r\n40. Mathieson concerned a child, Cameron, who was severely disabled and was\r\nentitled to DLA. He was admitted to hospital and his stay exceeded 84 days,\r\nwhereupon payment of DLA was suspended. He challenged the legislation having\r\nthat effect. As in the present case, the Secretary of State argued first that any\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 13\r\ndifference of treatment was not based on a status and secondly that it was in any\r\nevent justified.\r\n41. Lord Wilson said –\r\n“19. … Mr Mathieson argues that Cameron's status on 6 October 2010 was that\r\nof a severely disabled child who was in need of lengthy in-patient hospital treatment\r\nand that, in comparison with a severely disabled child who was not in need of\r\nlengthy in-patient hospital treatment, application to Cameron of the 84-day rule\r\ndiscriminated against him contrary to article 14. Any such comparator would need to\r\nbe a severely disabled child because otherwise he would not be entitled to DLA at\r\nall. But disability has degrees of severity and the suggested comparator could\r\npresumably be a child with a disability of severity either equal to, or indeed lesser\r\nthan, that of the child in need of lengthy in-patient hospital treatment.\r\n20. At first sight Mr Mathieson's contention appears contrived. Does it pass\r\nmuster? …”\r\nHaving considered AL (Serbia), RJM and Clift v United Kingdom, he decided that it\r\ndid.\r\n“23. Decisions both in our courts and in the ECtHR therefore combine to lead me\r\nto the confident conclusion that, as a severely disabled child in need of lengthy inpatient\r\nhospital treatment, Cameron had a status falling within the grounds of\r\ndiscrimination prohibited by article 14. Disability is a prohibited ground (Burnip v\r\nBirmingham City Council [2012] EWCA Civ 629, [2013] PTSR 117). Why should\r\ndiscrimination (if such it be) between disabled persons with different needs engage\r\narticle 14 any less than discrimination between a disabled person and an ablebodied\r\nperson? Whether, as in Cameron's case, the person is born disabled or\r\nwhether he becomes disabled, his disability is or becomes innate; and insofar as in\r\nthe RJM case Lord Walker seems to have had three circles in mind, Cameron's case\r\nfalls either within the narrowest of them or at least within the one in the middle.”\r\n42. Lord Mance said –\r\n“60. … To my mind, a child hospitalised free of charge (essentially in a NHS,\r\nrather than private, hospital) for a period longer than 84 days can be regarded as\r\nhaving a different status to that of a child not so hospitalised. …”\r\nLady Hale agreed only with Lord Wilson but Lord Clarke and Lord Reed agreed with\r\nboth Lord Wilson and Lord Mance and on this issue we are satisfied that there was\r\nno significant difference in their approaches. The status of Cameron was as a\r\ndisabled child who required hospital treatment such that he would lose entitlement to\r\nDLA under the legislation then in force and the comparator was a disabled child who\r\ndid not require such hospital treatment. The difference in treatment was due to the\r\ndifference in that status.\r\n43. In the present case, it is clear that DLA entitled PIP claimants are treated\r\ndifferently from new PIP claimants. Whether or not it is in itself a personal or\r\nidentifiable characteristic for the purposes of considering whether there has been\r\ndiscrimination in breach of Article 14, being in receipt of DLA obviously reflects the\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 14\r\nfact that a claimant is severely disabled and, perhaps more importantly in the\r\npresent case (because this is what distinguishes DLA entitled claimants of PIP from\r\nnew claimants), the fact that he or she has been severely disabled for some time. It\r\nseems to us that, following Mathieson, even if being entitled to DLA is not in itself a\r\npersonal or identifiable characteristic, it opens the door for an argument that a status\r\ncan be based on the length of time during which persons have been so disabled that\r\nthey are entitled to benefit. The identification of the status giving rise to the\r\ndifference in treatment may seem contrived on this approach, but Mathieson shows\r\nthat that may not be a bar to its success.\r\n44. On the other hand, if the Secretary of State satisfies us that the difference in\r\ntreatment is justified, the question whether it was due to a status becomes academic.\r\n45. A similar point arises in relation to the question whether the situation of DLA\r\nentitled PIP claimants is sufficiently analogous to that of new PIP claimants to\r\nrequire the difference of treatment to be justified. We agree with the Secretary of\r\nState that the second point Baroness Hale made about Article 14 in AL (Serbia) (see\r\nparagraph 34 above) makes it unnecessary to identify an exact, or sufficiently exact,\r\ncomparator as a free-standing question. Indeed, in our judgment, all the issues\r\nraised by Article 14 – whether there is a difference of treatment of people in\r\nanalogous situations, whether such a difference of treatment is on a suspect ground\r\nand, if so, whether it can be justified – are inter-related. That is not to say that the\r\nidentification of an exact, or sufficiently exact, comparator is not a necessary part of\r\nthe identification of the difference of treatment that is claimed to be on a prohibited\r\nground or a ground that has not been adequately justified. Such an exercise was\r\ncarried out in Mathieson in the context of answering the Secretary of State’s\r\ncontention that the difference in treatment was not based on a relevant status.\r\nHowever, arguments on justification may well demonstrate that a claimed comparator\r\nis not in a truly analogous situation, and therefore that the difference in treatment is\r\nnot actually due to a personal or other identifiable characteristic of the claimant at\r\nall, and we agree with the Secretary of State that matters that do not directly affect\r\neither the claimant or the identified comparator may be relevant to the question of\r\njustification. Moreover, as with status, it is not actually necessary for a tribunal to\r\ndecide whether the claimed comparator is in an analogous situation if the tribunal is\r\nsatisfied that the claimed difference in treatment is in any event justified,\r\n46. In these circumstances, we consider it easiest and perhaps necessary, in the\r\npresent case, to consider the Secretary of State’s arguments on justification in\r\nrelation to the claimant’s primary case before saying anything further about status or\r\ncomparators.\r\nDiscrimination – justification in relation to the claimant’s primary case, advanced by\r\nreference to all PIP winners\r\n47. In Stec v United Kingdom [2006] 43 EHRR 1017, it was held –\r\n“51. … A difference of treatment is … discriminatory if it has no objective and\r\nreasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if\r\nthere is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 15\r\nemployed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin\r\nof appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise\r\nsimilar situations justify a different treatment …”\r\nThe same point has been made domestically in many other cases (see, for example,\r\nHumphreys v Revenue and Customs Commissioners [2012] UKSC 18; [2012] 1\r\nWLR 1545, at paragraphs [15] to [21]) and has recently been affirmed by the\r\nSupreme Court in R. (Rutherford and others) v Secretary of State for Work and\r\nPensions [2016] UKSC 58; [2016] 1 WLR 4550, and it is not controversial in the\r\npresent case.\r\n48. We have been provided with witness statements from two senior officials in\r\nthe Department of Work and Pensions who explain the thinking behind both the\r\n2012 Act and the Transitional Regulations which, it is submitted by the Secretary of\r\nState, show that there were legitimate aims that have been pursued through\r\nproportionate means. Mr Philip Joseph addresses general benefit policy. Mr Bill\r\nHughes addresses operational policy.\r\n49. We have already mentioned that one avowed purpose of the 2012 Act was to\r\nsave money. Thus, it is not surprising that it was expected that there would be more\r\nPIP losers than there would be PIP winners, although the average amount lost by\r\nPIP losers and the average amount won by PIP winners would also be a factor. Mr\r\nJoseph records that, in January 2012, it was expected that 24% of DLA claimants\r\nwould be PIP losers who were not entitled to any PIP at all, 27% would be PIP losers\r\nwho would nonetheless be entitled to some PIP, 22% would be PIP neutrals and\r\n27% would be PIP winners. (A later forecast in December 2012 produced different\r\nfigures – 26%, 29%, 15% and 29% respectively – and we are told that current\r\nfigures are different again, but these differences do not materially affect the\r\narguments in this case.) In respect of the last three of those groups – those who\r\nwould be entitled to PIP – it was an important consideration that they should remain\r\nentitled to DLA while being assessed for PIP. In respect of the first two groups – PIP\r\nlosers – it was an additional consideration that they should remain entitled to DLA\r\nfor a further four weeks to soften the “cliff edge”. That therefore is part of the\r\nthinking behind regulation 17(1)(b) and (2) of the Transitional Regulations, which fix\r\nthe date for the termination of DLA and the commencement of any award of PIP.\r\n50. The main reasons behind those considerations are fairly obvious. It would\r\nhave been theoretically possible to terminate payments of DLA and then carry out\r\nthe assessments for PIP and that would have saved more money. However, that\r\nwould have left claimants without either DLA or PIP during the period of the\r\nassessment (as in the case of new claimants) even though 76% of them could\r\nexpect to be entitled to PIP at the end of the process and would have received a\r\npayment of arrears. That in turn would have given rise to discontent and so the\r\nadministrative cost in dealing with complaints. Moreover, PIP losers would need to\r\ntime to adjust to the possibility, and then certainty, that their income would be\r\nreduced – substantially in some cases – and we are told that that is one reason for\r\nthe four-week run on period, although another was the operational advantage of\r\nhaving sufficient time properly to terminate the DLA award and then start the PIP\r\none.\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 16\r\n51. Alternatively, it would theoretically have been possible to continue payments\r\nof DLA during the period of the assessment and then, if the restrictions on the\r\nrecovery of overpayments under section 71 of the Social Security Administration Act\r\n1992 were disapplied or modified, to seek to recover payments or parts of payments\r\nfrom PIP losers. However, that would have been obviously unattractive, giving rise\r\nto a great deal of discontent among claimants and a substantial administrative cost\r\neven in cases where recovery was realistically possible.\r\n52. It is therefore accepted by the claimant that the provisions for terminating an\r\naward of DLA and awarding PIP from a date four weeks after the decision on PIP\r\nentitlement was made are justified in relation to PIP losers and PIP neutrals.\r\nHowever, it is submitted that the provisions are not justified in relation to PIP winners\r\nand that there is no reason why PIP winners should be treated in exactly the same\r\nway as PIP losers and PIP neutrals. Obviously, the argument for maintaining\r\npayments of DLA during the period of assessment would have been as desirable for\r\nthem as for other claimants. Moreover, of course, at the beginning of the process,\r\nPIP winners could not be distinguished from PIP losers and PIP neutrals, but it is\r\nsubmitted that, once the outcome of the assessment was known, it would be possible\r\nto award PIP from the date of claim and offset the DLA paid when calculating the\r\narrears due and that the Regulations should have been so designed so that PIP\r\nwinners were not treated differently from successful PIP claimants who had not been\r\npreviously entitled to PIP.\r\n53. The Secretary of State submits that he was justified in not taking that\r\napproach both on practical grounds and on financial grounds. He does not suggest\r\nthat it would be wholly impractical to make PIP awards for PIP winners effective from\r\nthe date of claim and to set off the relevant amount of DLA, but it is submitted that\r\nthe operation would not be completely straightforward because it could not be\r\nautomated due to the new PIP computer system not being linked to the old DLA\r\ncomputer system. This would give rise to some administrative cost. However, the\r\ngreater financial cost would be the cost of paying the arrears of PIP to PIP winners,\r\nalbeit reduced by the setting off of DLA, which would represent a substantial\r\nreduction during the transitional period in the financial savings sought as a result of\r\nthe implementation of the 2012 Act.\r\n54. The claimant does not deny that backdating awards for PIP winners would\r\ngive rise to additional public expenditure, but it is submitted that that additional\r\nexpenditure is not relevant because it is the cost of the practice that is claimed to be\r\ndiscriminatory. In any event, the claimant submits that the Secretary of State\r\noverstates his case on both types of ground. We will consider both these issues in\r\nmore detail below. It is sufficient in relation to the claimant’s primary case to state\r\nthat it is clear that backdating PIP awards for PIP winners would result in some\r\nadditional administrative expense in addition to the cost of the payment of arrears\r\nwhich would itself be substantial on any footing.\r\n55. As regards PIP winners other than those within the Narrower Class of PIP\r\nwinners, and so most PIP winners, we consider that the legislation is clearly justified\r\nand that the claimant’s primary case under Article 14 fails to get off the ground,\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 17\r\npartly because it overlooks the implications of the fact that these Transitional\r\nRegulations are made to assist with the implementation of the 2012 Act and partly\r\nbecause most DLA entitled claimants of PIP are not in a situation that is truly\r\nanalogous to that of a new PIP claimant.\r\n56. It is not disputed that it would have been impractical for the 2012 Act to be\r\nbrought into force for all the relevant 1.8 million DLA claimants at the same time,\r\ngiven that there would have to be individual PIP assessments for each of them\r\n(albeit that some could be done without a medical consultation), not to mention the\r\nfact that new claims for PIP by those not entitled to DLA arrive at the rate of about\r\n8,000 per week and also require individual assessments. Although the 2012 Act\r\nmakes provision for it to be brought into force by a series of commencement orders,\r\nthere is no reason in principle why the gradual transition should not be managed\r\nthrough regulations making transitional provision, particularly given the width of the\r\npowers conferred by sections 93 and 94 of the 2012 Act. That is what the\r\nTransitional Regulations in this case achieve. It is therefore a legitimate effect of the\r\nTransitional Regulations that DLA entitled claimants will be transferred to PIP on\r\ndifferent dates and to that extent will be treated differently from one another. That\r\nprovides a prima facie justification for fixing the date of transfer for a DLA entitled\r\nperson who is a PIP winner on a different date from that fixed for a new PIP claimant.\r\n57. The Transitional Regulations happen to allow any DLA entitled claimant of\r\nworking age who wishes to do so to initiate the transfer, but such a claimant cannot\r\nhave any reasonable expectation that the transfer in his or her case will in fact take\r\nplace on any particular date. Indeed, had it been practical to do so, it is difficult to\r\nsee any legal reason why the Secretary of State should not have chosen to transfer\r\nall PIP losers before any PIP winners so as to maximise the financial savings,\r\nalthough there might have been a political cost in doing so. There can certainly be\r\nno objection to the Secretary of State fixing the date of transfer for most PIP winners\r\nin the same manner as for other DLA entitled claimants of PIP, rather than on the\r\ndate fixed for new PIP claimants. Moreover, the Secretary of State has financial\r\nreasons for doing so, both because of the lower administrative cost and because\r\nback-dating awards for PIP winners would obviously reduce the savings that are a\r\nlegitimate aim of the 2012 Act, particularly as the effective transfer date for PIP\r\nlosers is not being back-dated.\r\n58. This tends to show that PIP winners who are not in the Narrower Class are\r\nnot in a position analogous to a new PIP claimant. It is important to note that for\r\nthose not affected by the 2012 Act coming into force, a claimant to DLA under a fixed\r\nterm award and making a renewal claim is not in a position directly analogous to that\r\nof a new DLA claimant and is not treated in exactly the same way. Any renewal\r\nclaim can be made in advance and so does not take effect from the date of claim in\r\nthe way that an initial claim generally does. Instead it is treated as having been\r\nmade on, and so takes effect from, the day after the end of the existing award. This\r\ngenerally ensures that payments continue during the period of re-assessment. The\r\nTransitional Regulations achieve a similar effect for PIP winners, as well as for PIP\r\nlosers and PIP neutrals. (A renewal claim that justified an award at a different rate\r\nfrom the existing award might reveal information justifying a supersession of the\r\nexisting award before it came to an end, but that is a different situation analogous to\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 18\r\nthat of those in the Narrower Class of PIP winners. It would not necessarily do so\r\nbecause a difference of view as to the appropriate award does not necessarily give\r\ngrounds for supersession – see Cooke v Secretary of State for Social Security [2001]\r\nEWCA Civ 734 (reported as R(DLA) 6/01)).\r\n59. In any event, we are satisfied that for PIP winners other than those in the\r\nNarrower Class the difference of treatment is justified and therefore does not amount\r\nto discrimination. However, we consider that further considerations arise in respect\r\nof the Narrower Class of PIP winners.\r\nProper exercise of the regulation-making powers under the 2012 Act in relation to the\r\nNarrower Class of PIP winners\r\n60. We turn to consider this alternative argument before returning to the Article\r\n14 arguments and addressing justification in relation to the Narrower Class of PIP\r\nwinners. It is a rationality argument and the points made on it are also relevant to\r\nthe issues relating to justification.\r\n61. As we have explained, the Narrower Class of PIP winners are those PIP\r\nwinners who, not only claimed PIP following an invitation issued under regulation\r\n3(5) as a result of having notified the Secretary of State of a change of\r\ncircumstances relating to their awards of DLA, but also would have been awarded\r\nmore DLA had their awards been superseded in the light of the change of\r\ncircumstances. The combined effect of regulation 17(2) and regulation 20(2)(a) is\r\nthat such a claimant is unable during the time taken to make a PIP assessment to\r\nsecure the amount of benefit appropriate to his or her needs under either the DLA\r\nregime, by way of supersession for change of circumstances of the DLA decision, or\r\nthe PIP regime, by way of a back-dated PIP award. The amount of additional DLA\r\nthey would have received on supersession would not necessarily been the same as\r\nthe amount by which their award of PIP exceeded their award of DLA and they could\r\nnot have complained had they received only the lesser of the two amounts, but they\r\ncan legitimately feel hard done by because they received neither of those amounts.\r\n62. The validity of the legislation depends entirely on whether it falls within the\r\nscope of section 93(1). The question is therefore whether the Secretary of State can\r\nreasonably have regarded it as “necessary or expedient in connection with the\r\ncoming into force of this Part [of the 2012 Act]”. Those are very wide words, but they\r\ndo require the Secretary of State to provide at least some justification for a provision\r\nthat is capable of preventing a claimant from receiving part of the benefit to which he\r\nor she would have been entitled under legislation replaced by the 2012 Act for a\r\nperiod before he or she can become entitled to benefit under that Act.\r\n63. The Secretary of State argues that regulation 20(2)(a) is justified because one\r\nof the aims of the Transitional Regulations was to ensure that it would be\r\nunnecessary to make any further assessments for DLA purposes for any claimant\r\naged at least 16 and who was, on 8 April 2013, aged under 65. Any assessments in\r\nrespect of such claimants would be for PIP only. The reasons for this are addressed\r\nin Mr Hughes’ witness statement.\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 19\r\n64. First, he points out that supersession may be adverse to a claimant, rather\r\nthan favourable, and that the result of notifying a change of circumstances may not\r\nalways be the one the claimant anticipates. Thus, a claimant’s reporting a\r\nworsening in his or her condition may trigger a new assessment that results in a\r\nsupersession that reduces entitlement rather than increases it. Secondly, notifying a\r\nchange of circumstances may raise the question whether there should be a\r\nsupersession but seldom answers it. It would have been necessary to ask claimants\r\nwho had notified a change of circumstances to provide further information in addition\r\nto that required for the PIP assessment. Thirdly, it would be difficult to justify treating\r\ndifferently those who notified a change of circumstances before being invited to\r\nclaim PIP and those who did so subsequently or on their PIP claim – i.e., between\r\nthose within the scope of regulation 20(5) and those within the scope of regulation\r\n20(3) and (4) – and, indeed, it would be difficult to justify not giving all DLA entitled\r\nPIP claimants a specific opportunity to provide information that might result in their\r\nexisting awards being superseded. That would require each of them to complete a\r\n40-page DLA form as well as a 35-page PIP form, when most of them would not gain\r\nany advantage from doing so. Fourthly, it would therefore be necessary to carry out\r\na DLA assessment for all DLA entitled PIP claimants, which would give rise to\r\nsubstantial cost in staff time and to delay in individual cases and to the whole\r\ntransfer programme. The cost, Mr Hughes argues, would have been wholly\r\ndisproportionate to the benefit received. He estimates that the additional DLA that\r\nmight have been received over the whole 5-year transfer period by those DLA\r\nclaimants who would have gained as a result of such a process would have been\r\n£28 million but that the cost of the process would have been £52 million. There\r\nwould also be complications arising from the possibility that a DLA supersession\r\nmight not be effective for the whole of the period potentially in issue and, of course,\r\nthere would be further applications for revision and appeals.\r\n65. An alternative approach that would have avoided the need for any DLA\r\nassessments would have been to make provision in regulation 17 for the backdating\r\nof the awards of all PIP winners to the date of claim. Mr Hughes advanced an\r\noperational argument for not taking that approach, based on the difficulties that\r\nwould ensue as a result of off-setting DLA paid in respect of the relevant period, and\r\nMr Joseph advanced a financial argument.\r\n66. Mr Hughes says –\r\n“9. … Due to the limitations of the computer systems, backdating calculations\r\nwould have to been carried out manually, thereby creating a vast amount of\r\nadditional clerical work and admitting risks that manual error would bring. Having a\r\ncommon simple transparent system for the transfer of DLA claimants onto the\r\ncorrect level of PIP would reduce the strain on PIP operations. In order to succeed\r\nin keeping within the available constraints of staffing numbers, to keep within budget\r\nand to ensure correctness of outcome, it was necessary to keep the operational\r\nstrain to a reasonable limit. The current system of applying the 28 day run on\r\neveryone has established a level playing field for all PIP transfer claimants.”\r\nAs regards PIP winners, he explains what would be required.\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 20\r\n“The decision maker would make an award of PIP. Then PIPCS would liaise with\r\nDLACS and close down the DLA award 28 days later. The decision maker would\r\nthen make a manual amendment to the decision notice (a) stating that PIP would\r\nstart from the ate of claim and that DLA would end on the date 28 days following the\r\nnext payday, and (b) making reference to the amount and type of arrears that would\r\nbe made. … A further potential complication could arise here if the claimant goes\r\ninto hospital or has any other payability issues during the overlapping period. Any\r\nbackdating calculation would also have to take the payability issues into account.\r\nFinally after all complications were identified and taken into account, the decision\r\nmaker would have to calculate the arrears of PIP and clerically offset those arrears\r\nagainst the amount of DLA that had in fact been paid over the same period, then\r\nclerically make the payment adjustment, manually pay the arrears and send a written\r\nnotification explaining the offset to the claimant.”\r\nHe adds that the calculation could be further complicated because it might involve\r\nindividual days as well as complete weeks. Doing all this manually would, he\r\nargues, have created staffing issues and slowed down the whole transfer process\r\nwith a consequent loss of savings from the implementation of the 2012 Act.\r\nMoreover, running a different operational system for PIP winners from that for PIP\r\nlosers and PIP neutrals would have “created much additional operational strain for\r\nthe Department”.\r\n67. Mr Joseph argues that backdating PIP awards for PIP winners only would\r\nhave reduced the savings that could properly have been anticipated from\r\nimplementing the 2012 Act. In his first witness statement, he said that on “recent\r\nestimates”, the reduction across the whole transition period would be £320 million.\r\nAs explained below, he now says that the correct figure is £645 million. For the\r\nreasons given above, backdating awards of PIP for PIP losers and PIP neutrals,\r\nhaving stopped DLA payments at the beginning of the assessment period, in order to\r\nbalance the figures was not considered a possible policy.\r\n68. The claimant does not seriously dispute that carrying out DLA assessments\r\nwould have been disproportionate and impractical, but it is disputed that backdating\r\nPIP awards would be either disproportionately difficult in practice or\r\ndisproportionately expensive.\r\n69. In our judgment, the Secretary of State succeeds on the rationality argument.\r\n70. We accept that carrying out DLA assessments was not a realistic option for\r\nthe reasons given by Mr Hughes. Even if a process could have been devised that\r\nresulted only in DLA reassessments for PIP winners, it seems to us that the\r\nSecretary of State was clearly entitled to consider that it would have been\r\ndisproportionately time consuming and expensive to administer, quite apart from the\r\nextra burden it would have placed on claimants, the majority of whom would not have\r\ngained.\r\n71. In relation to backdating PIP awards, we see no reason to doubt that it would\r\nhave been impossible to arrange for the PIP and DLA computer systems to interact\r\nso as to produce the calculation automatically but we are not altogether convinced\r\nthat, taken by itself, that could have been a sufficient reason for not backdating PIP\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 21\r\nawards so as to ensure that any claimants who would otherwise have been\r\nprejudiced by not being able to apply for supersession of their DLA awards during\r\nthe PIP assessment period were adequately protected.\r\n72. However, we are quite satisfied that the Secretary of State was entitled to\r\nhave regard to the cost of backdating the awards of all PIP winners, given first that,\r\nin the absence of DLA assessments, it was not possible to identify those in the\r\nNarrower Class so that a substantial part of the back-dated payments would go to\r\nclaimants who would not in fact have been entitled to more DLA had there been a\r\nsupersession and secondly that he had powerful reasons for giving priority in the\r\ndesign of the transition to the needs of PIP losers and PIP neutrals.\r\n73. We accept that there is scope for argument about the cost of backdating\r\nawards for all PIP winners if PIP losers are transferred to the new régime only four\r\nweeks after the PIP assessment but, whatever the correct total figure, it is obvious\r\nthat, it is in the hundreds of millions of pounds. We also accept that the fact that that\r\nfigure is large merely reflects the number of claimants affected and the extent to\r\nwhich they are affected. But the important point is that the figure inevitably includes\r\nthe cost of back-dating awards to PIP winners who would not have been entitled to a\r\nhigher amount of DLA on supersession. It is legitimate for the Secretary of State to\r\ntake into account the further and unavoidable cost of backdating PIP for those PIP\r\nwinners who would not have been entitled to an increased amount of DLA had they\r\napplied for supersession. We do not have an estimate for the proportion of PIP\r\nwinners who would have been entitled to a higher amount of DLA on supersession.\r\nWe accept Mr Hughes’ point that it would be difficult to justify treating differently\r\nthose PIP winners in the Narrower Class, as defined for the purposes of this case,\r\nand those other PIP winners who would have been entitled to a higher amount of\r\nDLA on supersession but who notified the relevant change of circumstances after\r\nbeing invited to claim PIP but, even if the definition is widened and the proportion\r\nwere as high as a third (which we consider improbable), the Secretary of State would\r\nclearly have been entitled to regard the total cost of backdating awards for all PIP\r\nwinners to be disproportionate.\r\n74. Moreover, it seems to us to have been capable of being a material\r\nconsideration that DLA and PIP are both payable only to those expected to be\r\ndisabled for a substantial period, so that equally disabled people may not be eligible\r\nbecause their disability is expected to be for a relatively short period, and that they\r\nare not aimed at meeting a precise expense in the way that, say, housing benefit is.\r\nAn element of rough justice may therefore be more tolerable in this area than it might\r\nbe in other areas of social security provision.\r\n75. In these circumstances, we are satisfied that the Secretary of State could\r\nreasonably conclude that it was necessary or, at least, expedient for regulations\r\n17(2) and 20(2)(a) of the Transitional Regulations to have the effect that they do.\r\nDiscrimination - justification in relation to the claimant’s alternative case, advanced by\r\nreference to the Narrower Class of PIP winners\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 22\r\n76. As we have suggested above, it is arguable that the legislation gives rise to\r\nunequal treatment based on the length of time for which a person has been severely\r\ndisabled. It seems to us that the Narrower Class of PIP winners are in a situation\r\nmore analogous to that of successful new PIP claimants than to that of other DLA\r\nentitled PIP winners. Not only are both the Narrower Class of PIP winners and new\r\nPIP claimants severely disabled and qualified for PIP but also, assuming they were\r\nreceiving the correct amount of DLA or were correctly receiving no DLA, as the case\r\nmay be, they have both relatively recently become more disabled than they were\r\nbefore and are seeking the amount of benefit appropriate to the new level of their\r\ndisabilities. However, even if that is so, we are satisfied that the legislation is\r\njustified.\r\n77. The arguments on justification are essentially the same as the rationality\r\narguments, save that the claimant relies on the additional argument that cost is not\r\nmaterial at all. Although it was not in the bundle of authorities for the hearing, Mr\r\nMcGurk mentioned during the hearing O’Brien v Ministry of Justice [2013] UKSC 6;\r\n[2013] 1 WLR 522, in which the Supreme Court said –\r\n“69. … the European cases clearly establish that a Member State may decide for\r\nitself how much it will spend upon its benefits system, or presumably upon its justice\r\nsystem, or indeed upon any other area of social policy. But within that system, the\r\nchoices it makes must be consistent with the principles of equal treatment and nondiscrimination.\r\nA discriminatory rule or practice can only be justified by reference to a\r\nlegitimate aim other than the simple saving of cost. …”\r\n78. However, it is to be noted that the “European cases” mentioned were\r\ndecisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union rather than decisions of the\r\nEuropean Court of Human Rights. Care needs to be taken in seeking directly to\r\napply what was said in O’Brien to justification under Article 14. The attempt to do so\r\nin R. (SG and others) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2015] UKSC 16;\r\n[2015] 1 WLR 1149 was dealt with by Lord Reed in his consideration of whether the\r\nsocial security regulations there in issue pursued a legitimate aim\r\n“63. The next question is whether the Regulations pursue a legitimate aim. In my\r\nview that cannot be doubted. They pursue, in the first place, the aim of securing the\r\neconomic well-being of the country, as the Secretary of State explained to the\r\nParliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, and as is evident from the\r\nlegislative history since the policy of reducing expenditure on benefits was first\r\nannounced in June 2010. A judgment was made, following the election of a new\r\nGovernment in May 2010, that the current level of expenditure on benefits was\r\nunaffordable. The imposition of a cap on benefits was one of many measures\r\ndesigned to reduce that expenditure, or at least to constrain its further growth. It was\r\nargued on behalf of the appellants that savings in public expenditure could never\r\nconstitute a legitimate aim of measures which had a discriminatory effect, but that\r\nsubmission is inconsistent with the approach adopted by the European court in the\r\ncases mentioned in para 10. It is also inconsistent with the acceptance of the\r\neconomic well-being of the country as a legitimate aim of interferences with\r\nConvention rights under the second paragraphs of articles 8 to 11, and under A1P1.\r\nAn interpretation of the Convention which permitted the economic well-being of the\r\ncountry to constitute a legitimate aim in relation to interferences with the substantive\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 23\r\nConvention rights, but not as a legitimate aim in relation to the ancillary obligation to\r\nsecure the enjoyment of those rights without discrimination, would lack coherence.\r\n64. In relation to the case of Ministry of Justice (formerly Department for\r\nConstitutional Affairs) v O'Brien (Council of Immigration Judges intervening) [2013]\r\nUKSC 6; [2013] 1 WLR 522, para 69, on which the appellants relied, I would\r\nobserve that acceptance that savings in public expenditure can constitute a\r\nlegitimate aim for the purposes of article 14 does not entail that that aim will in itself\r\nconstitute a justification for discriminatory treatment. As I have explained, the\r\nquestion whether a discriminatory measure is justifiable depends not only upon its\r\nhaving a legitimate aim but also upon there being a reasonable relationship of\r\nproportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised.”\r\n79. In this case too, we have no doubt that the Transitional Regulations are\r\npursuing a legitimate aim, and the contrary was not argued before us. That aim was\r\npart of the more general aim of moving to PIP so as to reduce public expenditure\r\nand better focus social security benefits on the more seriously disabled, but more\r\nspecifically to ensure an effective and manageable transition from DLA to PIP for\r\nDLA claimants and one which protected the claimants’ entitlement to DLA until the\r\ntransition had been completed.\r\n80. That then leaves the question whether the Transitional Regulations maintain\r\na reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the\r\naims sought to be realised. We have no hesitation in concluding that they do for the\r\nsame reasons that we consider that the relevant provisions were rationally regarded\r\nas necessary or expedient. Here, claimants in the Narrower Class of PIP winners\r\nare caught in what is a hugely complex transition from one benefit to another (where\r\nthe saving of cost is a permissible aim) in the course of which many other claimants\r\nare expected legitimately to lose entitlement to some or all of the benefit they\r\nreceived. The design of the transition is deliberately aimed at protecting PIP losers\r\nand PIP neutrals, who would be treated less favourably than they are under the\r\nTransitional Regulations if PIP replaced DLA from the date of claim, and we are\r\nsatisfied that the protection of those claimants is a legitimate aim. In those\r\ncircumstances, regard may be had to whether the cost of protecting also those who\r\nmight have benefited from a DLA supersession would be disproportionate if the\r\nGovernment’s aims are to be pursued. We are satisfied that it would be, because it\r\nwould been disproportionate and so impractical to identify those who might have\r\nbenefited from a DLA supersession and make the necessary payments only to them.\r\nDelay in adjudication\r\n81. If the claimant would have been entitled to the middle rate of DLA during the\r\nperiod between her notification of her change of circumstances and the\r\ncommencement of her award of PIP, she has lost a not inconsiderable amount of\r\nmoney as a result of the Transitional Regulations. However, one reason was the\r\nlength of time taken to decide whether she was entitled to PIP, so that the period\r\nbetween the making of her claim and the date from which the award of PIP was\r\nmade effective was about twice the projected average figure. That seems to have\r\nbeen common in 2014. The legality of such delays was challenged in R. (C and W)\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 24\r\nv Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2015] EWHC 1607 (Admin). Patterson\r\nJ found the delays of 14 months and 10 months respectively in the cases before her\r\nto be not only unacceptable but also unlawful. This issue is not before us in relation\r\nto the present claimant. We merely observe that the particular position of those\r\nclaimants whose condition has deteriorated such that they might have qualified for\r\nan increase in the award of DLA but for the Transitional Regulations appears not to\r\nhave been raised in C and W, where neither claimant was entitled to DLA.\r\nAccuracy of statistics\r\n82. Immediately before the hearing, it became clear to Mr Buley that the figure of\r\n£320 million given by Mr Joseph in his witness statement as the cost over the whole\r\ntransition period of backdating claims for PIP winners might be inaccurate. An error\r\nwas identified and we were informed. Following the hearing, a further error emerged\r\nand Mr Joseph made a further statement, explaining what the true figure was and\r\nhow the wrong figure had been given and apologising for the two errors that had\r\nbeen made.\r\n83. We accept that the errors were inadvertent. They were caused by a lack of\r\ncommunication between Mr Joseph and the analysts providing the information. One\r\nerror was in respect of the period to which the figure of £320 million related. It had\r\nbeen based on a calculation in respect of only the part of the transition period that\r\nremained at the date of the calculation, rather than the whole period from the\r\nbeginning. The other was the omission of the cost of the four-week run on period,\r\nwhich needed to be added to the time taken to make the PIP decision. Each of\r\nthese errors resulted in the figure being less than it should have been with the\r\nconsequence that it therefore did not assist the Secretary of State’s case and so\r\nclearly was not deliberate. The Secretary of State nonetheless rightly recognises\r\nthat it is a matter of considerable concern that there were errors in evidence\r\nsubmitted to the Upper Tribunal by his department.\r\n84. The errors would not have occurred if Mr Joseph had been more precise in\r\nhis instructions to the analysts as to the periods for which he wanted calculations to\r\nbe made. Indeed, his original statement included the erroneous estimate based on\r\nunpublished figures that we were not then given for the proportion of PIP losers to\r\nPIP winners, while providing us with earlier published estimates of the proportion of\r\nPIP losers and PIP winners. This use of figures relating to different periods is liable\r\nto make accurate analysis difficult. If figures given in evidence in legal proceedings\r\nare important, they are likely to be questioned and inconsistencies exposed. Mr\r\nMcGurk and Dr Strothers are right to point out that if the Department had given them\r\nthe underlying calculations for figures mentioned at the permission hearing, for\r\nwhich they had asked before Mr Joseph’s statement was provided, the errors would\r\nprobably have been spotted then. Care needs to be taken.\r\n85. We accept Mr Joseph’s apology and we hope that this sort of error is not\r\nmade again in evidence provided by the Department for Work and Pensions.\r\nTW v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (PIP) [2017] UKUT 25 (AAC)\r\nCPIP/2980/2015 25\r\nMr Justice Charles\r\nChamber President\r\nMark Rowland\r\nStewart Wright\r\n17 January 2017","tribunal_decision_categories":["human-rights-law","personal-independence-payment-general"],"tribunal_decision_decision_date":"2017-01-17","tribunal_decision_judges":["three-judge-panel"],"tribunal_decision_sub_categories":["human-rights-law-article-14-non-discrimination"]},"max_cache_time":10,"temporary_update_type":false,"attachments":[{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/58982f6940f0b6070b000014/CPIP_2980_2015-00.pdf","title":"CPIP/2980/2015","content_type":"application/pdf","updated_at":"2017-02-06T08:10:17+00:00","created_at":"2017-02-06T08:10:17+00:00","content_id":"967b7d6e-f293-4de7-99d7-9dd2664a65e6"}],"headers":[{"text":"Judicial Summary","level":2,"id":"judicial-summary"}],"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2017-02-06T08:10:57.325Z"}]},"routes":[{"path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions/tw-v-secretary-of-state-for-work-and-pensions-pip-2017-ukut-25-aac","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"specialist-publisher","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"utaac_decision","schema_name":"specialist_document","first_published_at":"2017-02-06T08:10:57Z","base_path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions/tw-v-secretary-of-state-for-work-and-pensions-pip-2017-ukut-25-aac","description":"Upper Tribunal Administrative Appeals Chamber decision by Mr Justice Charles, Judge Rowland and Judge Wright on 17 January 2017.","content_id":"97f10432-247f-466a-b87f-116f78055cd3","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"D18","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice","base_path":"/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice","content_id":"dcc907d6-433c-42df-9ffb-d9c68be5dc4d","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-07-18T17:26:49Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Ministry of Justice","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"ministry-of-justice","logo":{"formatted_title":"Ministry<br/>of Justice","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}},{"analytics_identifier":"EA73","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service","base_path":"/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service","content_id":"6f757605-ab8f-4b62-84e4-99f79cf085c2","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-02-21T14:12:20Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"HM Courts & Tribunals Service","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"ministry-of-justice","logo":{"formatted_title":"HM Courts &amp; <br/>Tribunals Service","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}},{"analytics_identifier":"PB1142","api_path":"/api/content/courts-tribunals/upper-tribunal-administrative-appeals-chamber","base_path":"/courts-tribunals/upper-tribunal-administrative-appeals-chamber","content_id":"4c2e325a-2d95-442b-856a-e7fb9f9e3cf8","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-06-18T16:08:53Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber)","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":null,"logo":{"formatted_title":"Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber)"}},"links":{}}],"finder":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions","base_path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions","content_id":"e9e7fcff-bb0d-4723-af25-9f78d730f6f8","description":"Find decisions on appeals to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber), including social security and child support appeals.","document_type":"finder","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-03-30T10:34:00Z","schema_name":"finder","title":"Administrative appeals tribunal decisions","withdrawn":false,"details":{"document_noun":"decision","filter":{"document_type":"utaac_decision"},"format_name":"Administrative appeals tribunal decision","show_summaries":true,"summary":"<p>Find decisions on appeals to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber), including social security and child support appeals.</p><p>This includes decisions made from January 2016 onwards.
