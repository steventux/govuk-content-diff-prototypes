Introduction\r\nThis is an appeal against the decision of the Traffic Commissioner for\r\nthe North East of England (“the TC”) made on 19 May 2016 when he\r\nrefused to order the return of a vehicle to Bolle Materieel BV (“BM”)\r\nwhich had been detained under reg.3 of the Goods Vehicles\r\n(Enforcement Powers) Regulations 2001 (as amended) (“the 2001\r\nRegulations”).\r\n2. Unless permitted to do so under an exemption, it is unlawful in the\r\nUnited Kingdom (“UK”) to use a goods vehicle on a road, for the\r\ncarriage of goods, either for hire or reward or for or in connection with\r\nany trade or business carried on by the user of the vehicle, without\r\nholding an operator’s licence issued under s.2 of the Goods Vehicles\r\n(Licensing of Operators) Act 1995 (“the 1995 Act”). Use of a goods\r\nvehicle in contravention of s.2 of the 1995 Act is a criminal offence\r\npunishable by a fine not exceeding £5,000.\r\n3. One of the exemptions referred to in paragraph 2 above, is the use of a\r\nvehicle for international carriage by a haulier established in another\r\nMember State (see s.2(2)(b) of the 1995 Act). International carriage is\r\ndefined by Council Regulation (EC) No. 1072/2009 (“the 2009\r\nRegulation”) as being “a laden journey undertaken by a vehicle the\r\npoint of departure and the point of arrival of which are in two different\r\nMember States, with or without transit through one or more Member\r\nStates or non-member countries”. It follows that the use of a vehicle\r\nfrom another Member State with the appropriate authorisation to bring\r\nan incoming international load into the UK will not be operating\r\nunlawfully. We have underlined “laden” in the above passage as in the\r\nTribunal’s lead case on this issue T/2011/60 Nolan Transport v Vehicle\r\n& Operator Services Agency & Secretary of State for Transport (2012\r\nUKUT 221 (AAC) (“Nolan”), “laden” was omitted from the definition in\r\nparagraph 14 of that decision as the Tribunal had erroneously quoted\r\nfrom a previous Regulation which has since been superseded by the\r\n2009 Regulation. By virtue of Article 2 of the 2009 Regulation,\r\n3\r\n“vehicle” means “a motor vehicle registered in a Member State, or a\r\ncoupled combination of vehicles the motor vehicle of which at least is\r\nregistered in a Member State, used exclusively for the carriage of\r\ngoods”.\r\n4. By virtue of the 2009 Regulation, any haulier for hire or reward from\r\nanother Member State whose vehicle has entered the UK whilst\r\ndelivering an incoming international load and who then complies with\r\nthe conditions set out in Article 8 of the 2009 Regulation, may also take\r\nadvantage of a further exemption which is known as “cabotage”.\r\nArticle 8(2) provides:\r\n“Once the goods carried in the course of an incoming international\r\ncarriage have been delivered hauliers referred to in paragraph 1 shall\r\nbe permitted to carry out, with the same vehicle, or in the case of a\r\ncoupled combination, the motor vehicle of that same vehicle, up to\r\nthree cabotage operations following the international carriage from\r\nanother Member State ..”\r\nThis clearly permits an incoming vehicle, after the last unloading of its\r\ninternational carriage, to undertake three further collections and\r\ndeliveries, known as “cabotage operations” within the UK before the\r\nvehicle leaves the country. The three cabotage operations must take\r\nplace within seven days from the last unloading of the incoming\r\ninternational carriage (if there is more than one). This is known as the\r\n“three in seven rule”.\r\n5. Cabotage operations will only be deemed to conform to the 2009\r\nRegulation if the haulier can produce clear evidence of the incoming\r\ninternational carriage and of each consecutive cabotage operation\r\ncarried out. Article 8(3) sets out the precise nature of the\r\ndocumentation required to be produced by the driver. Such evidence\r\nmust be kept in the vehicle and must be available for inspection at any\r\nroadside check (see paragraph 53 of the Nolan decision).\r\n6. It follows that once a vehicle undertaking international carriage has\r\nunloaded the incoming load, then unless the vehicle can be shown to\r\nbe operating in accordance with the “three in seven” cabotage rule and\r\nis carrying all of the necessary evidence set out in Article 8(3) of the\r\n2009 Regulation, the vehicle will be operating in contravention of\r\nsection 2 of the 1995 Act.\r\n7. The Nolan case is the lead authority on the issues of international\r\ncarriage and the cabotage and impounding regimes. Its status is\r\nenhanced by the constitution of the Tribunal which was made up of two\r\njudicial members and a single specialist member to reflect the legal\r\nimportance of the issues it was required to determine. As was\r\nrecognised in the Nolan case (paragraph 233) that this Tribunal is not\r\nstrictly bound by its earlier decisions, it is recognised that on rare\r\n4\r\noccasions, where there are compelling reasons for doing so, it can\r\ndepart from previously settled principles.\r\n8. Background circumstances to the impounding\r\nBolle Transport BV is a Dutch registered transport company with a\r\nDutch operator’s licence and a European authorisation permitting Bolle\r\nTransport to engage in the international carriage of goods. The\r\ncompany is part of a group controlled by Cees Bolle, the majority\r\nshareholder of the holding company, Bolle Holding BV. BM is the\r\nentity within the group which owns the tractor units and trailers\r\noperated by Bolle Transport.\r\n9. In the period 13 December 2011 to 24 July 2015, vehicles which were\r\nbeing operated by Bolle Transport were stopped by VOSA or its\r\nsuccessor, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (“DVSA”) on\r\nseventeen occasions and found to have been operating otherwise than\r\nin the course of international carriage or within the strict confines of the\r\ncabotage regime. On each occasion, prohibition notices were issued\r\nto Bolle Transport and the vehicles were directed out of the country. In\r\naddition, fixed penalty notices were issued to Bolle Transport on ten\r\noccasions arising out of prohibitions issued; two were later withdrawn\r\nupon Bolle Transport producing the documentation that should have\r\nbeen carried by the drivers under Article 8(3) of the 2009 Regulation.\r\nThe prohibition notices in those two instances were nevertheless\r\nvalidly issued. This was confirmed to “John” of Bolle Transport in an\r\nemail sent by Mark Horton, Traffic Enforcement Policy and Scheme\r\nManager on 15 January 2015, in response to “John’s” enquiry.\r\n10. On 20 March 2014, Bolle Transport was sent a letter by the DVSA\r\nOperational Support Team explaining that as the company’s vehicles\r\nhad been repeatedly found to be in breach of the cabotage regime, that\r\nas at 3 April 2014 any further vehicles found to be operating in\r\ncontravention of s.2 of 1995 Act would be detained indefinitely. As a\r\nconsequence of this enforcement history, Bolle Transport was one of\r\nthe operators on the DVSA “watch list” of repeat offenders against the\r\ncabotage regime. In addition, Traffic Examiner (“TE”) Berriman had\r\nspoken to Mr Bolle on more than one occasion about his vehicles being\r\nfound to be in breach of the cabotage regime.\r\n11. On 24 July 2015, a Volvo tractor unit registration BZ-TV-19 (“the\r\nvehicle”) and semi trailer bearing the registration OH-84-RX was\r\nescorted into the DVSA check site in Immingham for a roadside\r\ninspection. The driver, Andrew Richards, a British national, told TE\r\nBerriman that he was on his way from the Humber Sea Terminal at\r\nKillinghome with the semi trailer OH-84-RX laden with flowers on a\r\njourney to Motherwell via Bradford. He had collected the trailer from\r\nthe Humber Sea Terminal on behalf of his employer, Bolle Transport.\r\nMr Richards produced the documentation for the semi trailer OH-84-RX\r\n5\r\nbut was unable to produce the documentation for the loaded trailer he\r\nhad brought into the UK. Mr Richards refused to be interviewed\r\nwithout first taking legal advice. TE Berriman came to the conclusion\r\nthat as the driver could not produce the documentation required under\r\nArticle 8(3) of the 2009 Regulations (evidence of the incoming\r\ninternational carriage), the vehicle was being operated illegally within\r\nthe UK. Having taken advice from within VOSA he was then\r\nauthorised to impound the tractor unit by Intelligence Officer Vosper.\r\n12. The original application for return of the vehicle was submitted on\r\nbehalf of Bolle Transport. That application had not been included\r\nwithin the appeal papers. At a hearing before Deputy Traffic\r\nCommissioner Harrington on 14 September 2015, it became apparent\r\nto her, that the application had been made by the wrong legal entity,\r\nalthough at that stage, this was disputed by Mr Clarke of Counsel who\r\nrepresented Bolle Transport. Further, as his skeleton argument raised\r\ntwo issues which were not within the original application, namely,\r\nwhether firstly, Bolle Transport’s name should have been on the DVSA\r\nwatch list at all and secondly, whether the vehicle had been impounded\r\nin accordance with the DVSA policy, the application was adjourned to\r\nallow BM to make an application and for the DVSA to be legally\r\nrepresented so that the legal issues arising out of Mr Clarke’s skeleton\r\nargument could be addressed.\r\n13. A renewed application was submitted by Mr Bolle on behalf of BM on\r\n25 September 2015. The application was made under paragraph 10 of\r\nthe 2001 Regulations, relying on paragraph 4(3)(b) of those\r\nregulations:\r\n“that (the vehicle) was not being, and had not been, used in\r\ncontravention of section 2 of the 1995 Act”.\r\nThe relevant details of the application were as follows:\r\n“.. The vehicle is in fact operated under a lawful Dutch Operators\r\nLicence .. by Bolle Transport BV Netherlands .. and with a valid\r\nEuropean Permit to so operate in EEC Member States.\r\nIt is contended that at the material time the vehicle with a trailer on the\r\nmorning of the stop had just dis-embarked from the ferry at the Port of\r\nImmingham on an overnight sailing from the Hoek van Holland. It thus\r\ncould not possibly have been in breach of the said cabotage\r\nregulations and thus did not at the material time require a valid UK\r\nOperators’ Licence to lawfully operate haulage operations within the\r\nUK ..”\r\n14. The hearing of the application was listed for 3 December 2015. On 13\r\nOctober 2015, Mr Tinkler, solicitor instructed by Mr Bolle, sent an email\r\nto the DVSA stating that an additional limb to the application was to be\r\nrelied upon, namely:\r\n6\r\n“(i) Should the DVSA policy have been applied against the Applicant\r\nin any event in view of the fact that two previous allegations of\r\ncabotage cited earlier in 2015 (sic) against the Applicant were\r\nsubsequently withdrawn by the DVSA and\r\n(ii) Was the DVSA policy applied lawfully as against the Applicant at\r\nthe time of the stoppage in the light of (i) above and should Bolle\r\nTransport have been included on a DVSA “list” kept by them of\r\nwhat the DVSA claim to be previous cabotage “operator\r\noffenders”?”.\r\n15. On 2 December 2015, Mr Nesbitt, who was instructed on behalf of the\r\nDVSA, signed off his skeleton argument in preparation for the hearing\r\nlisted for 3 December 2015. Whilst his skeleton dealt with Mr Bolle’s\r\ncontention that the vehicle had not been operating in breach of s.2 of\r\nthe 1995 Act, it would appear that he had not been made aware of the\r\nadditional limb to the application as Mr Nesbitt’s skeleton argument did\r\nnot address the additional points. In any event, when Mr Clarke’s\r\n“Speaking Note” dated 1 December 2015 was served, it became\r\napparent that the application now included a third, alternative limb,\r\nnamely, that if the TC found that the vehicle was being used in\r\ncontravention of s.2 of the 1995 Act, that Mr Bolle was not aware of\r\nthat fact. As a result, the hearing was adjourned so that the DVSA\r\ncould obtain further witness evidence in relation to that additional limb.\r\nThe hearing was re-listed for 20 April 2016 (there may have been some\r\ncorrespondence and even a short hearing prior to this date but there is\r\nno evidence of such in the appeal bundle).\r\n16. On 10 March 2016, Mr Tinkler notified the DVSA that the additional\r\nlimb of the application as set out in paragraph 13 above was no longer\r\nrelied upon and that:\r\n“the only challenge from the Appellant goes to the issue of the\r\nlawfulness of the stop itself namely whether or not the Applicant was or\r\nwas not conducting a cabotage operation and whether the Applicant\r\nwas engaged in international transport”.\r\n17. The Public Inquiry 20 April 2016\r\nAt the hearing of the application, Mr Clarke represented BM with Mr\r\nBolle in attendance and Mr Nesbitt represented the DVSA with TE\r\nBerriman in attendance. The hearing proceeded upon the following\r\nStatement of Agreed Facts:\r\n“1. At approximately 10.30am on the 24th July 2015, the Applicant’s\r\nDutch-registered and owned tractor unit BZ-TV-19 was encountered by\r\nan officer of DVSA (sic) at Manby Road, Immingham.\r\n7\r\n2. The vehicle was pulling the Applicant’s Dutch-registered and owned\r\ntrailer OH-84-RX, loaded with flowers from Holland.\r\n3. In answer to questions by the DVSA officer, the driver of the vehicle\r\nstated following (sic):\r\ni. He was working for the Applicant. He had arrived that morning\r\non the Stena Line ferry from Hoek van Holland.\r\nii. He produced his Stena Line ferry ticket to the officer.\r\niii. He was working for the Applicant. He had recently left the\r\nHumber Sea Terminal at Killingholme bound for Bradford and\r\nMotherwell. He had boarded the ferry pulling trailer number\r\n552970.\r\niv. Trailer K41206 was disembarked from the ferry and into the\r\nunaccompanied trailer park by a port-employee utilising a portowned\r\nshunter, or tug, vehicle (sic).\r\nv. Two trailers operated by the Applicant also boarded the ferry:\r\ni. 552970/89-BDB-6 and\r\nii. K41206/OH-84-RX.\r\nvi. Upon docking at the Humber Sea Terminal, Killingholme on the\r\nmorning of the 24th July, that being the day of this encounter,\r\nBZ-TV-19 disembarked from the ferry at 08.10am.\r\nvii. Trailer K41206/OH-84-RX was disembarked from the ferry at\r\n07.00am.\r\nviii. The contents of the trailer 552970/89-BDB-6 were delivered to\r\nan address in Falkirk, Scotland on the 26th July.\r\nix. The contents of trailer K41206/OH-84-RX were delivered to an\r\naddress in Bradford on the 24th July.\r\nx. He had then collected trailer K41206 from the unaccompanied\r\ntrailer park at the Humber Sea Terminal and left the Humber\r\nSea Terminal at Killingholme bound for Bradford and\r\nMotherwell.\r\nxi. The only documentation held by him was that related to the load\r\ncontained within his present trailer, OH-84-RX (K41206).\r\nxii. By reason of the driver’s responses, the DVSA officer concluded\r\nthat BZ-TV-19 was in breach of s.2 of the (1995 Act) and did not\r\nfall within the exemptions provided by (the 2009 Regulations)....\r\n7. The Traffic Officer could not say who had made the decision to seize\r\nand impound the vehicle, although he understood it was a Senior\r\nOfficer within the DVSA. It had not been him; the decision had been\r\nrelayed to him and he had carried it into effect.”\r\n18. Mr Clarke began by formally withdrawing the limb of the application\r\nbased upon whether the DVSA policy had been complied with in the\r\nprocess leading up to the impounding and also the alternative limb\r\nasserting lack of knowledge of unlawful use on the part of Mr Bolle.\r\nThe sole remaining basis of his application was that the vehicle was\r\nundertaking international carriage at the time it was stopped. It was\r\naccepted that the vehicle could not be said to be performing cabotage\r\n8\r\nalthough if the driver had been carrying the paperwork for the vehicle’s\r\nentrance into the UK with trailer 89-BDB-6, it was unlikely that the\r\nvehicle would have been impounded. Mr Clarke then proceeded to\r\ngive evidence. Bolle Transport had directed Mr Richards to take a\r\ntrailer to the UK and at the same time, accompany a second trailer\r\nwhich he was responsible for “into the United Kingdom”. The “original\r\nidea” was that once in the UK, the driver would take one trailer on to its\r\ndestination whilst the other trailer would be collected by a driver\r\nalready in the UK. For operational reasons, once disembarked, Mr\r\nRichards was told that he should uncouple from the trailer he had taken\r\noff the ferry and proceed to take the second trailer to its destination. It\r\nfollowed that at the time the vehicle was stopped it was hauling the\r\n“unaccompanied trailer” which had been taken off the ferry by a port\r\nemployee. The issue was therefore whether a driver who brings in two\r\ntrailers on a ferry and then moves one onto its end destination, is\r\nengaging in international carriage or cabotage. It was Mr Clarke’s\r\nsubmission that it was the former. The spirit of the 2009 Regulations\r\nwas to protect the domestic market from unfair competition. However,\r\nin this case, the domestic market was “enhanced” by the driver bringing\r\ntwo trailers into the country with one vehicle because he was providing\r\nwork for a vehicle already in the UK.\r\n19. Mr Clarke took the TC to Article 8(2) of the 2009 Regulations. He\r\nhighlighted the following passages:\r\n“Once the goods carried in the course of an incoming international\r\ncarriage have been delivered ...\r\nThe last unloading in the course of a cabotage operation before leaving\r\nthe host Member State shall take place within 7 days from the last\r\nunloading in the host Member State in the course of the incoming\r\ninternational carriage”.\r\nMr Clarke submitted that the above passages provided a working\r\ndefinition of “delivered” in that the draftsman clearly meant that\r\n“delivered” meant “unloaded”. It followed that unless and until the\r\ntrailer which had been brought into the UK by way of the initial\r\ninternational carriage had been delivered to its destination, the\r\ninternational journey of the tractor unit had not come to an end. In this\r\ncase, all that happened was that the trailer was parked up following\r\ndisembarkation. It followed that the vehicle was in fact undertaking\r\ninternational carriage in coupling up with the second trailer for onward\r\ndelivery. Mr Clarke took the TC to paragraph 21 of the Nolan which\r\nreads:\r\n“....First, it is a pre-condition to the right to carry out cabotage\r\noperations that there has been an “incoming international carriage”.\r\nHowever for the purpose of triggering the right to conduct cabotage\r\noperations the definition of “incoming international carriage” is narrower\r\nthan that set out.. above. The reason is that the right to conduct\r\n9\r\ncabotage operations only commences once “the goods carried” on the\r\nincoming international carriage “have been delivered”.\r\nMr Clarke submitted that “for those reasons”, the journey being\r\nundertaken by the vehicle when it was stopped could never have been\r\na cabotage operation because the incoming goods had not been\r\ndelivered. Rather it was a journey which fell into the definition of\r\n“international carriage of goods”.\r\n20. In response, Mr Nesbitt submitted that the position in this case was\r\nstraightforward. He reminded the TC of the definition of “international\r\ncarriage” set out in Article 2(a) of the 2009 Regulation as set out in\r\nparagraph 3 above. The international journey undertaken by the\r\nimpounded vehicle whilst coupled to trailer 89-BDB-6 commenced in\r\nHolland and its point of arrival was the port at Killingholme. It was at\r\nthat stage that its load was detached from the tractor unit and left in the\r\nport for another vehicle to haul to its delivery destination or destinations\r\nin the case of groupage. The process of uncoupling from its load and\r\nthen proceeding out of the port with a different trailer, resulted in the\r\nvehicle’s international carriage coming to an end. In paragraph 15 of\r\nNolan decision, the Tribunal had made it clear that the transportation of\r\nunaccompanied trailers from a port could not constitute international\r\ncarriage. The submissions made on behalf of BM ran contrary to the\r\nlanguage of the 2009 Regulation and to the decision in Nolan and to\r\naccede to the application would drive a “coach and horses” through the\r\nsystem that the EU had established in order to give permission for\r\nvehicles registered in one Member State to carry out work in another\r\nMember State. The system balanced the need for the regulation of the\r\nuse of goods vehicles in road safety terms with the need of some\r\nhauliers to undertake road transport work in other Member States. If\r\nBM’s submissions were correct, then a tractor unit could arrive in a port\r\ncoupled to one trailer with any number of other uncoupled trailers\r\noperated by the same haulier on the same ferry. Once de-coupled\r\nfrom the trailer it had brought into the country, the tractor unit could do\r\ninnumerable shunting type activities coupled to the other trailers and\r\nstill be classified as undertaking international carriage until such time\r\nas the trailer it had been attached to was delivered. Indeed another\r\ntractor unit could take the trailer which the tractor unit had brought into\r\nthe country and that tractor unit would also be performing international\r\ncarriage because the goods had not been “delivered”.\r\n21. Mr Clarke disagreed that his interpretation of the 2009 Regulation\r\ncould lead to that conclusion. Unaccompanied trailers arrive in the UK\r\nevery day and they are then removed from unaccompanied trailer\r\nparks by either domestic hauliers or by overseas hauliers undertaking\r\nlawful cabotage. It could not have been conceived by the draftsman of\r\nthe 2009 Regulation that the point of arrival would be the port rather\r\nthan the true and final point of delivery as set out in the paperwork and\r\nwhen the goods were finally unloaded. He denied that the second\r\ntrailer on the ferry could be categorised as “unaccompanied” as it was\r\n10\r\ntravelling with Mr Richards. Mr Clarke took the TC to paragraph 69 of\r\nNolan which is entitled “Unaccompanied Trailers”. The Tribunal in that\r\nparagraph set out three ways in which unaccompanied trailers could be\r\nmoved without a breach of s.2 of the 1995 Act which were firstly by a\r\ndomestic haulier, secondly by those entitled to conduct cabotage and\r\nthirdly, by way of combined transport. The Tribunal went on:\r\n“Whether there is any other way in which a loaded trailer can be moved\r\nwas not the subject of argument. If it ever arises the point must be\r\ndecided in another appeal ..”\r\nMr Clarke submitted that the Tribunal was indicating in that passage\r\nthat it was not “closing the door” to other ways in which an\r\nunaccompanied trailer could be moved from a port and as a result, it\r\nwas open to the TC to find in favour of BM and order the return of the\r\nvehicle.\r\n22. The TC’s determination\r\nThe TC’s starting point was the definitions of “vehicle” and\r\n“international carriage” both set out in paragraph 3 above. He then\r\nconsidered paragraph 15 of Nolan which determined:\r\n“Initially the view taken by NT was that the definition of international\r\ncarriage was either wide enough to apply to an unaccompanied trailers,\r\nor if that was wrong, it should be extended to cover such trailers. As\r\nwe understand the position it is now accepted that the interpretation is\r\nwrong. In our view NT are right to make that concession. International\r\ncarriage involves a journey by a “vehicle”. In the case of articulated\r\nvehicles the definition of vehicle requires that a trailer can only take\r\npart in international carriage if coupled to a tractor unit. To make the\r\npoint crystal clear a journey undertaken by an unaccompanied trailer\r\nfrom, for example, a port in Ireland to a port in Wales, cannot amount\r\nto international carriage”.\r\nThe TC concluded that the language was clear and as a result, he\r\nfound that the trailer that was coupled to the vehicle at the time of the\r\nDVSA encounter had not taken part in international carriage.\r\n23. The TC could not find anything in the 2009 Regulation that referred to\r\nthe need for the incoming load to be delivered to its final destination\r\nbefore the vehicle ceased to be undertaking international carriage. He\r\ntook a “very pragmatic and simple view”. The vehicle had been uncoupled\r\nfrom the trailer it brought into the UK whilst in the port. It then\r\ntravelled within the port to couple up with another trailer. The vehicle\r\nhad therefore travelled unladen whilst in the port. The first trailer was\r\ndestined for Bradford. The goods contained in the trailer itself may\r\nhave had further distances to travel before they could be said to be\r\n“delivered” in the true sense. For the 2009 Regulation to have any\r\n11\r\nmeaningful sense and to be enforceable, it could only mean to refer to\r\nthe first delivery point where the load had been completely removed.\r\nIn this case, the load was the trailer and its contents and they were\r\ncompletely delivered to the quayside at Killingholme. The vehicle’s\r\njourney with the second trailer commenced at Killingholme and was a\r\ndomestic journey. It followed that the only legal way in which that\r\njourney could take place was by way of legal cabotage. It was\r\nhowever accepted by BM that the cabotage regime could not be relied\r\nupon in this case as Mr Richards did not carry the required paperwork\r\nwith him. The TC therefore concluded that when the vehicle was\r\nstopped it was operating in contravention of s.2 of the 1995 Act and he\r\nrefused the application for the return of the vehicle.\r\n24. The TC considered the delays in the proceedings to be “deeply\r\nregrettable” and avoidable. The parties” should have “stuck” to the\r\nsimple grounds of the application for the return of the vehicle. Issues\r\nof whether the DVSA had applied and followed its own internal policy\r\nwere of no interest or relevance to the determination a TC had to come\r\nto when considering whether a vehicle should be returned. Had the\r\napplication been argued on simple, narrow grounds, the application\r\ncould have been determined six months earlier.\r\n25. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal\r\nAt the hearing of this appeal, Mr Clarke of Counsel appeared on behalf\r\nof BM and Mr Nesbitt of Counsel appeared on behalf of the DVSA.\r\nBoth produced skeleton arguments for which we were grateful.\r\n26. As a preliminary point, Mr Clarke abandoned a ground of appeal based\r\nupon the TC’s “obiter” comments in which he determined the he should\r\nnot be concerned about whether the DVSA had applied and followed\r\nits own internal policy relating to the impounding of vehicles when\r\ndeciding whether a vehicle should be returned. Mr Clarke was correct\r\nto make this concession as the issue had no direct bearing upon the\r\nTC’s decision making process.\r\n27. Mr Clarke then outlined the basis of the appeal. There were two main\r\npoints. The first was whether the vehicle, when it was stopped, was\r\nundertaking an international or a domestic journey. If the TC’s\r\ndetermination that the vehicle was undertaking a domestic journey was\r\ncorrect, the second point was whether the regulations should be\r\ninterpreted in such a way as to provide the TC with a residual\r\ndiscretion to order the return of the vehicle. Mr Clarke appreciated that\r\nthe law appeared to be settled on this point by virtue of the Nolan\r\ndecision but he wished to re-address it as he could not see how, in the\r\nabsence of such a residual discretion being read into the regulations,\r\nthe impounding regime could be consistent with s.3 of the Human\r\nRights Act 1998 (“the 1998 Act”).\r\n12\r\n28. So, dealing first with the issue of the correct categorisation of the\r\njourney being undertaken by the vehicle when it was stopped, Mr\r\nClarke appreciated that the weight of the authorities on this issue\r\ntended to favour the TC’s findings because the definition of “vehicle”\r\nwithin Article 8(2) of the 2009 Regulation referred to a “coupled\r\ncombination” and that was how the vehicle entered the UK although\r\ncoupled to trailer 89-BDB-6. However, in this case, Mr Richards was\r\nnot just responsible for that trailer but also for trailer OH-84-RX for\r\nwhich he held the paperwork. That second trailer could not therefore\r\nbe described as “unaccompanied”. In those circumstances, the process\r\nof de-coupling from 89-BDB-6 whilst in the confines of the port area\r\nand the coupling up to OH-84-RX could not and should not cause the\r\noriginal international journey to come to an end. Mr Richards was\r\nentitled to undertake that process whilst holding the paperwork for both\r\ntrailers. Further, as the activity was so confined in physical terms,\r\nbeing within the port area, it was not proportionate to find that the\r\nvehicle’s international carriage had come to an end. Mr Clarke\r\nrepeated the submissions he made before the TC in relation to Article\r\n8(2) of the 2009 Regulation and went on to submit that by virtue of the\r\nwording of that Article, international carriage was only deemed to have\r\ncome to an end once the goods were actually delivered (see paragraph\r\n19 above). In finding that the delivery of the vehicle’s goods (in this\r\ncase the laden trailer 89-BB-6) had taken place as soon as the trailer\r\nhad been un-coupled from the tractor unit at the port, the TC had\r\nstrained the definition of “delivery”. Mr Clarke highlighted that Article\r\n8(2) used the words “delivery” and “unloaded” interchangeably and that\r\nas a result, delivery meant “unloaded”. In the circumstances, it could\r\nnot possibly be that the goods brought into the UK by the vehicle in the\r\ncircumstances agreed in this case, had been delivered. Whilst the\r\ntrailer remained at the port, the goods remained “in transit”.\r\n29. Mr Clarke then turned to the issue of discretion and proportionality. He\r\nsubmitted that first of all, the regulations should be read and interpreted\r\nwith a purposive approach being taken. That would ensure that the\r\nregulations were not interpreted too narrowly so as to defeat the object\r\nof the regulations. The proper approach of a TC should be for the TC\r\nto ask “does the Applicant’s conduct offend the purpose of the\r\nregulations?” The purposive approach had previously been approved\r\nand indeed taken by the Tribunal in the appeal of T/2011/25 Asset 2\r\nAsset Limited (2011 UKUT 290 (AAC) (see paragraph 21 where the\r\npurposive approach was adopted in the context of identifying the\r\ncorrect approach to the concept of “knowledge” in impounding cases).\r\nMr Clarke referred to the preamble of the 2009 Regulation and\r\nsubmitted that it was clear that the purpose of the Regulation was to\r\nprotect the domestic market from unfettered and unfair competition\r\nfrom non-domestic hauliers until such time as the EU wide market is\r\nharmonised. The process undertaken by the vehicle in this case had\r\nno bearing or impact upon the domestic market as it did not pose a\r\nthreat in the sense of collection or delivery within that market because\r\nthe vehicle was not engaged in point to point internal haulage within\r\n13\r\nthe UK and in any event, an international haulier is entitled to deliver\r\nhis own load and is not compelled to contract with the domestic market\r\nfor the delivery of goods once they have arrived at a domestic port.\r\n30. Turning to the issue of proportionality, Mr Clarke referred the Tribunal\r\nto the TC’s statement at the conclusion of his decision, made in the\r\ncontext of whether he was required to consider whether the DVSA had\r\nfollowed its own policy when impounding a vehicle. It reads: “I am\r\nsimply able to look to see whether any one of the four grounds of return\r\ncan be made out”. Mr Clarke submitted that this approach was too\r\nnarrow and restrictive and failed to take proper account of the Human\r\nRights Act 1998 and in particular ss.3, 6 and 7 and Article 1 of Protocol\r\n1 of the European Convention of Human Rights. In short, the TC\r\nshould have interpreted the regulations so as to allow for a residual\r\ndiscretion to be exercised in appropriate cases so as to satisfy the\r\nconcept of proportionality. Without such an approach, the 2001\r\nRegulations offended the principle of proportionality because the TC\r\nwas prevented from measuring the breach against the penalty to be\r\nsuffered by the party concerned.\r\n31. In support of his submissions, Mr Clarke referred the Tribunal to the\r\nAdministrative Court decision of Commissioners of Customs v Ian\r\nNewbury (2003) EWHC 702 (Admin). Mr Clarke referred the Tribunal\r\nto paragraph 8 of that judgment which described the regime of seizure\r\nand forfeiture of goods imported without payment of duty under s.141\r\nand paragraph 6 of Schedule 3 to the Customs and Excise\r\nManagement Act 1979 (the subject matter of the decision). He\r\nsubmitted the regime described was similar to that of the impounding\r\nregime, not least as a result of the unremitting nature of the penalty. In\r\nthat case, the Administrative Court held that by virtue of Article 1 of\r\nProtocol 1 to the European Convention on Human rights, a discretion\r\nmust be read into the powers of the VAT Tribunal when conducting\r\nreviews of decisions of VAT Commissioners who themselves had a\r\ndiscretion under s.152(a) of the 1979 Act. Mr Clarke accepted that at\r\nparagraph 270 of Nolan, this Tribunal had previously considered this\r\npoint (including the case of Newbury) and had concluded that the\r\nimpounding regime struck a fair balance between the rights of the\r\nindividual vehicle owner and the interests of the State, on behalf of the\r\npublic generally, in securing compliance with the system of operator’s\r\nlicensing in order to promote road safety and fair competition and that\r\nin the circumstances, there was no need to read down the provisions of\r\nthe impounding regime in order to include an element of discretion. Mr\r\nClarke submitted that the difficulty with that determination was that by\r\nvirtue of s.3(1) of the 1998 Act, subordinate legislation must be read\r\nand given effect in a way which was compatible with Convention rights\r\nand that was mandatory. Further, in the same paragraph, the Tribunal\r\nfound that it was difficult to envisage any circumstances in which after\r\nthe failure of a claim for the return of a vehicle it would, nevertheless,\r\nbe appropriate to exercise a discretion to return the vehicle. That\r\nfinding itself was in stark contrast to the “entire casting” of the 1998 Act\r\n14\r\nwhich was directed towards the proposition that there were “no fixed\r\nrules” and that a single decision covering all cases would always be\r\ndisproportionate and unfair. Mr Clarke contended that it cannot be\r\nright for an owner who swaps two trailers at a port to be subject to the\r\nsame penalty as an owner who is found to be repeatedly in breach of\r\nthe cabotage regime. There were degrees of culpability and if the\r\nimpounding regime does not allow the TC to measure the degree of\r\nculpability and to assess the value of the vehicle which is important in\r\nassessing the proportionality of the penalty, then it is a disproportionate\r\nregime. The breach in this case, if there was one, was highly technical\r\nand it should not have resulted in the impounding of the vehicle.\r\n32. Discussion\r\nWe have chosen not to summarise Mr Nesbitt’s submissions made on\r\nbehalf of the DVSA as we agree with them and as such they are\r\nreflected in the discussion below.\r\n33. It is BM’s case that the vehicle was undertaking international carriage\r\nwhen it was stopped by TE Berriman. It is agreed by both parties that\r\nin the event that we uphold the TC’s determination that the vehicle\r\ncould not have been undertaking international carriage, then it was\r\noperating in breach of s.2 of the 1995 Act and it is not now suggested\r\nthat Mr Bolle did not know that it was being so operated.\r\n34. International carriage can only be performed by a laden vehicle which\r\nstarts its laden journey in one Member State and finishes that same\r\nladen journey in another Member State (see paragraph 4 above for the\r\nprecise definition). The definition of vehicle “shall” mean a motor\r\nvehicle registered in a Member State or a coupled combination of\r\nvehicles (see paragraph 4 above for the precise definition). An\r\nuncoupled trailer cannot fall within the definition of “vehicle” because it\r\nis not a motor vehicle. It follows that a trailer can only take part in\r\ninternational carriage if, it is part of a coupled combination with a tractor\r\nunit and that was the conclusion of the Tribunal in Nolan (see\r\nparagraph 15). We find that the suggestion that trailer OH-84-RX was\r\nnot an unaccompanied trailer because Mr Richards was on board the\r\nferry with the relevant paperwork for it and that therefore the trailer in\r\nsome way fell within the definition of international carriage to be\r\nmisconceived. The use of the term “unaccompanied” is one that is\r\ncommonly used within the haulage industry (which is why ports have\r\nareas designated for “unaccompanied trailers” which are removed from\r\nferries by port staff and taken to the designated area). The concept of\r\naccompaniment does not involve the presence or absence of a\r\nrepresentative of a haulier on board a ferry. Rather, the term\r\n“unaccompanied” means that the trailer is not attached or coupled to a\r\ntractor unit which embarked with the trailer onto the ferry and then\r\ndisembarked with the trailer still attached to it, It is only a coupled\r\ncombination which can be said to be engaged on international carriage.\r\n15\r\nThe combination of the vehicle comprising tractor unit BZ-TV-19\r\ncoupled to trailer OH-84-RX which was stopped by TE Berriman was\r\nconstituted at the port in Killingholme. It cannot therefore be said to be\r\na vehicle which was on a journey, the point of departure and the point\r\nof arrival of which are in two different Member States. It was not\r\ntherefore engaged in international carriage.\r\n35. The Tribunal has been urged to adopt a purposive approach to the\r\ninterpretation of the Regulation so as to find that unaccompanied\r\ntrailers could fall within the definition of international carriage. There is\r\nnothing in the pre-amble to the Regulation which could possibly be\r\ninterpreted as envisaging the inclusion of unaccompanied trailers in the\r\ndefinition of either “vehicle” or “international carriage” and the\r\ndefinitions are themselves clear. There is no ambiguity of language or\r\npurpose in the Regulation and we can see no compelling reason why\r\nwe should do anything other adopt and endorse paragraph 15 of\r\nNolan.\r\n36. Turning then to Mr Clarke’s submissions that an international carriage\r\njourney only comes to an end when the goods which were carried into\r\nthe country by the vehicle are finally delivered to their end destination\r\nand that in the absence of such delivery, the tractor unit continues to\r\nperform international carriage, we are satisfied that the TC’s decision\r\nwas correct although for different reasons. Article 8(2) of the 2009\r\nRegulation deems that the incoming international carriage comes to an\r\nend when the goods are delivered by the vehicle combination and it is\r\nat that stage that hauliers, using the same tractor unit or vehicle, are\r\nthen permitted to perform cabotage. It is clear from the wording of\r\nArticle 8(2) and (3) that incoming international carriage must be\r\ncompleted by the same tractor unit without the un-coupling of the\r\ntractor unit and trailer (see paragraph 5 above). It does not envisage a\r\nsituation where the tractor unit, having “parked” the trailer, then\r\nperforms other work and in particular, the carriage of another trailer\r\nusing the protection of the inward international carriage journey which\r\nhas not yet been completed. Neither does it envisage or allow for the\r\nde-coupling of the tractor unit from the trailer and the delivery of the\r\ntrailer and its contents using another tractor unit (as took place in this\r\ncase). At the moment when the tractor unit and the trailer were\r\nseparated and the tractor unit performed other work then the protection\r\ngiven by performing international carriage came to an end without\r\ndelivery having been achieved by that vehicle. As a result, neither the\r\ntractor unit nor the trailer could be said to be engaged in international\r\ncarriage from that point. The vehicle could not be performing cabotage\r\nbecause the vehicle had not delivered its incoming load and it could not\r\ncomply with Article 8(3) because it could not provide evidence of\r\nhaving delivered its incoming load. The vehicle combination when\r\nstopped must therefore have been undertaking a domestic journey for\r\nwhich a UK operator’s licence was required\r\n16\r\n37. As for Mr Clarke’s separate point about the use of the word “unloading”\r\nin Article 8(2) in the context of cabotage operations, we do not consider\r\nthere to be anything in the point. The Tribunal has already noted that\r\n“delivery” is used in the context of the incoming international carriage\r\nand it is anticipated by Article 8(2) and (3) that it is the incoming vehicle\r\ncombination that effects delivery of the goods. That did not take place\r\nin this case because the motor vehicle was diverted to other work. The\r\ninternational carriage came to an end at that stage.\r\n38. Turning then to proportionality and whether it is necessary to read into\r\nthe 2001 Regulations a residual discretion for the TC to exercise in\r\nappropriate cases, this matter was fully argued before the Tribunal in\r\nNolan including consideration being given to the case of Newbury.\r\nMany statutory regimes may at first blush appear to be similar and it is\r\nonly when the regimes are considered in detail that a proper analysis of\r\nthem can take place. In Nolan, this was achieved with the benefit of\r\ndetailed submissions made by Mr Nesbitt on behalf of Nolan Transport,\r\nMr Nardell QC on behalf of the Ministry of Transport and Mr Hallsworth\r\non behalf of VOSA. The Tribunal considered its previous decisions on\r\nthe point (2004/152 Frank Meager and 2007/172 Romantiek Transport\r\nBVBA and others) and in addition to Newbury, the authorities of Air\r\nCanada v UK (1995) 20 EHRR 150, Lindsay v Commissioners of\r\nCustoms & Excise (2002) EWCA Civ 267, O’Leary International Ltd v\r\nThe Chief Constable of North Wales and Crown Prosecution Service\r\n(2012) EWHC 1516 (Admin) were considered. We can do no better\r\nthan to replicate the relevant section of Nolan in this decision for ease\r\nof reference:\r\n“254. In our view the starting point for deciding whether or not the\r\nimpounding regime strikes a fair balance ought to be an explanation of the\r\nreason why the impounding regime was introduced and its importance to\r\nenforcing the regulatory regime for HGV’s (and now, in addition, Public\r\nService Vehicles). All operators holding GB operator’s licences come within\r\nthe jurisdiction of Traffic Commissioners. Under s. 26 of the 1995 Act Traffic\r\nCommissioners have a discretionary power to ‘revoke, curtail or suspend’ an\r\noperator’s licence on a number of grounds. Those grounds include, for\r\nexample, the fact that the operator’s vehicles have incurred safety related\r\nprohibition notices or that the operator has breached any undertaking recorded\r\non the licence. A standard undertaking is that the operator will make proper\r\narrangements so that the rules on driver’s hours and tachographs are observed\r\nand proper records are kept, which are to be made available on request. In\r\nmore serious cases a Traffic Commissioner is required, by s. 27 of the 1995\r\nAct, to revoke an operator’s licence if satisfied that the operator no longer\r\nmeets the requirement to be of good repute or of appropriate financial standing\r\nor professionally competent. In other words operators within the system who\r\noperate in a way which puts public safety or fair competition at risk can be put\r\nout of business by the revocation of their licence.\r\n255. By contrast, until the impounding regime was introduced, those whose\r\nlicences had been revoked or those who had simply not bothered to apply for a\r\n17\r\nlicence or foreign operators, operating outside the exemptions we have\r\ndescribed, risked a maximum fine of £5,000 for use of a vehicle in\r\ncontravention of s. 2 of the 1995 Act, (see paragraph 7). In practice fines were\r\nfrequently set at a level well below the maximum. The result was that many\r\nof those who were operating outside the system simply treated the fines as a\r\nform of business expense and continued to operate unlawfully, competing\r\nunfairly with those who were compliant and putting public safety at risk.\r\n256. Mr Hallsworth annexed two documents to his most recent submission,\r\n(we suggest that for future reference both are filed in the Authorities Bundle at\r\ntab 7, which contains other material relevant to impounding). The first of\r\nthese documents is the Regulatory Impact Assessment, prepared as part of the\r\nprocess during which the impounding regime was created. The second is the\r\nExplanatory Memorandum, which was put forward when the 2001\r\nRegulations were amended by the 2009 Regulations and Public Service\r\nVehicles became liable to impounding for the first time. Since this was the\r\nfirst time these documents featured in the case we gave Mr Nesbitt and Mr\r\nNardell QC the opportunity to make further submissions before we decided\r\nwhat weight to attach to them. Mr Nardell QC indicated that there was no\r\nneed for the Secretary of State to make further submissions\r\n257. Mr Nesbitt provided us with a further skeleton argument dated 26 June\r\n2012. He submitted that it was for us, and not a Minister or a Department, to\r\ndecide how these provisions are to be construed. He went on to indicate that\r\nhe was not submitting that the impounding regime is incompatible with the\r\nProtocol merely that it is possible to read it and that it should be read in a way\r\nwhich renders it compatible. Next he submitted that the thrust of the\r\ndocuments is that the problem lies with domestic rather than foreign operators\r\noperating outside the system. Finally he submitted that any assessment of the\r\nfairness of the impounding regime goes deeper than the superficial assessment\r\nin the second of the passages quoted at paragraph 259 below and that it can\r\nonly be achieved by the inclusion of a power to return vehicles where it would\r\nbe disproportionate not to do so.\r\n258. We agree that it is our responsibility to construe these provisions and\r\nthat extra-judicial comments as to what they mean cannot bind us. We cannot\r\naccept that the thrust of the documents is solely directed to domestic hauliers.\r\nIn our view the impounding regime is directed at those who operate,\r\nunlawfully, outside the operator’s licensing regime. The purpose of allowing\r\nexemptions for foreign hauliers, on a temporary basis, is to achieve a balance\r\nbetween the interests of the haulier, in operating efficiently, and the interests\r\nof the public in the safe operation of HGVs. In our view foreign hauliers, who\r\noperate outside the permitted exemptions, increase the risk to the public, either\r\nbecause their vehicles are not properly maintained or because they are lax in\r\ntheir observance of drivers’ hours and tachograph regulations or for both and\r\npossibly other reasons. In this respect the figures relating to NT, at paragraph\r\n156 above are instructive. We agree with Mr Nesbitt that we must make our\r\nown assessment of the overall fairness of the balance struck by the\r\nimpounding regime. In this respect the quotations from the two documents,\r\nwhich we have set out in the next two paragraphs, provide useful background\r\ninformation about the nature of the problem with which the regime is intended\r\nto deal. We would simply add two points. First, the comments about illegal\r\n18\r\noperators in the second half of the second quotation in paragraph 259 apply\r\nwith just as much force to foreign hauliers as they do to domestic hauliers.\r\nSecond, one only has to consider the number of GFPs incurred by NT, to see\r\nthat the need for the deterrent effect of the impounding regime is just as\r\nimportant in relation to foreign hauliers as it is in relation to domestic hauliers.\r\n259. In the Regulatory Impact Assessment the following appears under the\r\nheading ‘Risk Assessment’:-\r\n“A roadside survey of HGVs carried out by the Vehicle Inspectorate (VI)\r\nin October 1995 found that 1.9% of the vehicles stopped were found to\r\nbe operating illegally. As a proportion of the present HGV fleet of about\r\n420,000 vehicles, this represents some 8,000 HGV’s. The VI survey also\r\nfound that illegally operated HGVs are twice as likely to have dangerous\r\nroadworthiness defects as legally operated HGVs. Illegally operated\r\nHGVs are therefore a significant danger to the safety of other road\r\nusers. HGV’s have a lower involvement rate in accidents per 100\r\nmillion vehicle kilometres travelled than cars (46 compared to 90)\r\nreflecting their greater use of motorways and lower use of urban roads.\r\nHowever, their fatality rate in these accidents is twice that of cars\r\nbecause they cause much more damage to the pedestrians or vehicles\r\nwith which they collide. When involved in accidents with pedestrians,\r\nHGVs are up to six times more likely to kill a pedestrian than cars”.\r\nA little later the following appears under the heading ‘Issues of equity and\r\nfairness’:-\r\n“The detention of HGVs would deprive a person of his private property\r\nand means of livelihood and would be justified if it were in the public\r\ninterest. But by ignoring the operator licensing system, illegal operators\r\ncut costs and undermine fair competition amongst the law-abiding\r\nmajority of the road haulage industry. Illegal operators also avoid the\r\nvetting and review of their operating centres by Traffic Commissioners,\r\nwhich in turn removes the statutory and democratic rights of local\r\nauthorities and local residents to object or make representations against\r\nan operator’s licence being granted on grounds of road safety, local\r\nsuitability or the environment. There has therefore been considerable\r\npressure for some time, particularly by road safety groups and road\r\nhauliers, for action to be taken against illegal operators”.\r\n260. The second document put forward by Mr Hallsworth is the\r\n‘Explanatory Memorandum’, which was put forward when the 2001\r\nRegulations were amended by the 2009 Regulations and, at the same time, an\r\nimpounding regime was introduced in relation to Public Service Vehicles.\r\nUnder the heading ‘Successful Use of Impounding with HGVs’ in a document\r\ndescribed as the ‘Evidence Base’ the following appears at paragraphs 11 and\r\n12:-\r\n“In 2002 a scheme for the seizure and impounding of illegally operated\r\nHGVs was established” (under the 1995 Act) … . Since the\r\nimplementation of this scheme the proportion of HGVs used on GB\r\nroads without the appropriate Operator Licence has dropped from 1.7%,\r\n(in 2001), to 0.6%, (in 2006), as measured by the VOSA roadside\r\n19\r\ncompliance survey. At the same time the number of applications for\r\nHGV Operator Licences increased.\r\nThis seems to show that the HGV impounding scheme has been an\r\neffective deterrent to illegal operation. As was anticipated when the\r\nscheme was planned, the volume of vehicles impounded has been low\r\n(fewer than 250 per year) – but significant benefit has been achieved\r\nthrough the deterrent effect. Results from the HGV scheme have also\r\nshown that the vehicles used by those operators who choose persistently\r\nto remain outside the Operator Licensing system (and hence are subject\r\nto being impounded) tend to be vehicles which are not maintained to safe\r\nstandards – therefore there is a wider safety benefit from this\r\nenforcement activity”.\r\n261. In our view these documents serve to reinforce the common sense\r\nposition that the State has a strong and legitimate interest, on behalf of the\r\npublic generally, in ensuring that HGVs are properly maintained and safely\r\noperated by operators who comply with the operator’s licensing system and\r\ncompete fairly with other hauliers. The quotations we have set out show the\r\nbenefit achieved by the deterrent effect of the targeted impounding of a\r\nrelatively small number of vehicles. In our view the impounding regime\r\nmakes an important contribution to the enforcement of the operator’s licensing\r\nregime and to road safety generally.\r\n262. It is convenient, at this stage, to return to the point made by Mr Nardell\r\nQC that the impounding regime represents a well-balanced and carefully\r\ncrafted scheme set out by Parliament itself. The bald statement, at paragraph\r\n81 above, as to the way in which the 2000 Act amended the 1995 Act, does\r\nnot do justice to the attention which Parliament gave to the impounding\r\nregime. Parliament did not merely provide for a wide and general discretion\r\nto enable the Secretary of State to make regulations to bring the impounding\r\nregime into effect. Instead it gave the matter detailed consideration. Schedule\r\n1A to the 2000 Act, which was added to the 1995 Act by s.262(2) of the 2000\r\nAct, started life as Schedule 30 to the 2000 Act. Although framed in\r\ndiscretionary terms, “regulations may provide …”, it nevertheless set out a\r\ndetailed framework, which was carefully followed when the 2001 Regulations\r\nwere drafted. In particular paragraph 9(4) of Schedule 1A, as set out in\r\nSchedule 30, provides that the grounds on which the return of a vehicle can be\r\nordered “may include the following grounds”. The three grounds set out in\r\nparagraph 9(4) were included, word for word, in the 2001 Regulations. They\r\ndo not, of course, include any general discretion to return a vehicle on any\r\nother ground. The amendment of the 2001 Regulations by the 2009\r\nRegulations was effected by using the regulation making powers granted by\r\nSchedule 1A to the 2000 Act but subject, of course, to Parliamentary approval\r\nbefore the amended regulations came into force. The amendments benefitted\r\nowners in two ways. First, a new Regulation 4 was substituted for the old one,\r\nwhich provided for a requirement that a detained vehicle should be returned,\r\nwithout the need for an application to a Traffic Commissioner, if the\r\nauthorised person was satisfied that one of the grounds on which a Traffic\r\nCommissioner could order the return of the vehicle was made out. In other\r\nwords, in a clear case, it enabled the owner to secure the return of a vehicle\r\nmore quickly. Second, a fourth ground for return was added to the three\r\n20\r\nalready set out in Regulation 10(4). While this is not, in our view, a decisive\r\npoint it is an important point which needs to be borne in mind in making an\r\noverall assessment of the balance achieved by the impounding regime.\r\n263. We have already described the impounding regime, and the\r\nconsequences which follow when a vehicle is impounded, in paragraphs 81-90\r\nabove. In the course of the hearing we were provided with a document setting\r\nout VOSA’a approach when deciding whether a vehicle should be impounded,\r\n(it is Section 48 from a larger document, with the heading ‘Deciding who to\r\nImpound’, it should have been filed at tab 7 in the authorities bundle). In our\r\nview this provides important background material in assessing whether or not\r\nthere is any need to give Traffic Commissioners an element of discretion over\r\nthe return of impounded vehicles. The first step in the process which may lead\r\nto a decision to impound is for a VOSA area, which considers that an\r\noperator’s vehicle ought to be impounded, to submit a case to a local meeting.\r\nSeven criteria are given which justify the submission of a case. NT probably\r\nmet two of them. They would have come within (d) as an operator using a\r\nforeign registered vehicle, not on a licence in the UK, engaged in a UK\r\noperation not within the scope of cabotage and they probably came within (e)\r\nas an operator who had received numerous recorded warnings regarding illegal\r\noperation but had chosen to ignore the advice. The case papers to be\r\nsubmitted to the meeting must include, amongst other things, the enforcement\r\nhistory. If there is agreement at the meeting that the operator should be\r\ntargeted for impounding there is then a requirement that further evidence\r\nshould be gathered under a number of headings. The next step, following a\r\ndecision to target an operator for impounding, is that VOSA must send a letter\r\nto all parties with an interest in the vehicle or vehicles in question. An\r\nexample, from the present case, is the letter of 28 January 2011, quoted at\r\nparagraph 160. In other words if VOSA’s approach is followed there is no\r\nquestion of a vehicle being impounded ‘out of the blue’ because the operator\r\nand owner, (if different and ascertained) will have been warned and given 14\r\ndays in which to change their ways. It is only when this letter is sent that a\r\n‘marker’ is put on the roadside system so that if the vehicle is stopped the\r\nperson stopping it knows that impounding should be considered. The marker\r\nalso ensures, if a vehicle is stopped before the period specified in the letter has\r\nexpired, that the stopping officer knows that while prosecution may be\r\nappropriate impounding is premature. If those receiving a letter, such as that\r\nof 28 January 2011, satisfy the appropriate VOSA officer that they have taken\r\nsteps which will result in the vehicle ceasing to be used in contravention of s.\r\n2 of the 1995 Act then the marker can be removed from the system. In other\r\nwords if this procedure is followed it will only be those operators who have\r\nchosen to ignore the written warning that they are operating in contravention\r\nof s. 2 whose vehicles are at risk of being impounded.\r\n264. In our view if the impounding regime is properly applied it provides\r\nsignificant protection to any operator who is not persistently and deliberately\r\noperating in contravention of s. 2 of the 1995 Act. We believe that it is\r\nimportant, when assessing whether or not a fair balance has been struck, to\r\ntake into account how the regime operates.\r\n265. We have considered what the position would be if VOSA failed to\r\nfollow their policy, (described at paragraph 259), and did impound a vehicle at\r\n21\r\nrandom. We have explained at paragraph 90 that it is for VOSA to show, on\r\nthe balance of probability, that they had the right to detain the vehicle.\r\nWithout expressing any final view on the point it seems to us that it would be\r\nopen to an owner to put VOSA to proof that they had the right to impound\r\nand, in doing so, to raise the question of whether or not VOSA had followed\r\ntheir policy. Even if this point failed, in the absence of a warning letter,\r\nVOSA would be very well aware that they might find it difficult to resist a\r\nclaim for the return of the vehicle on, for example, the ‘lack of knowledge’\r\nground. It follows, in our view, that it is very much in VOSA’s interests to\r\nensure that their policy is followed.\r\n266. Next it is open to an owner, whose vehicle has been impounded, to\r\nseek to persuade VOSA to return it under regulation 4 of the 2001 Regulations\r\nas amended, (see paragraph 83). This is an informal procedure, which does\r\nnot require a hearing. It was probably the basis on which the vehicle\r\nimpounded on 13 April 2011 was returned to NT. Operators who believe that\r\nthey have a good case for the return of a vehicle would be well-advised to seek\r\nto persuade VOSA of its merits, at this stage, in order to secure the early return\r\nof the vehicle.\r\n267. One of the matters advanced by Mr Nesbitt to justify the incorporation\r\nof an element of discretion into the impounding regime was the possibility that\r\na vehicle could be impounded because of a minor defect or series of defects in\r\nthe paperwork. In our view there is no need for this situation to be dealt with\r\nas a matter of discretion because it can be raised in the course of an\r\nimpounding hearing. If, for example, the clear evidence required by Article\r\n8.3 is provided by the driver, at the roadside, and it presents a picture of a\r\nvehicle which has been conducting lawful cabotage operations, then it seems\r\nto us that VOSA would not ‘have reason to believe’ that the vehicle was being\r\nor had been used in contravention of s. 2 of the 1995 Act simply because some\r\nof the ‘Is’ on the documents were not dotted or ‘Ts’ were not crossed. In that\r\nsituation the owner would be entitled to explore the position when the relevant\r\nevidence was taken and would also be entitled to request the Traffic\r\nCommissioner to rule on the point, which could then, if necessary be appealed.\r\nA ruling that VOSA had failed to establish a right to impound the vehicle\r\nwould result in the return of the vehicle to the owner.\r\n268. Once VOSA have established that they did have the right to impound\r\nthe vehicle it is then open to the owner to apply for the return of the vehicle on\r\nany one or more of the four grounds set out in paragraph 10(4) of the 2001\r\nRegulations as amended, (see paragraph 86). It is true that the burden of\r\nestablishing each of these grounds falls on the owner but this is hardly\r\nsurprising when the matters giving rise to these grounds are peculiarly within\r\nthe owner’s own knowledge. In our view these grounds enable an owner who\r\nwas, for example, merely negligent or was unaware of the use in contravention\r\nof s. 2 of the 1995 Act to obtain the return of their property. In other words it\r\nreinforces the position that impounding is directed at a small number of\r\noperators who knowingly and persistently operate in contravention of s. 2 of\r\nthe 1995 Act and are undeterred from so doing by the other means available to\r\nthe enforcement authorities.\r\n22\r\n269. While the 2001 Regulations, as amended, do not, expressly, require\r\nthat the value of the vehicle is taken into account on any decision as to\r\nwhether or not a vehicle is to be returned, they do ensure that it is taken into\r\naccount indirectly. This is because of the provision in regulation 18, (see\r\nparagraph 88), that requires any surplus, after payment of the charges for the\r\ndetention and storage of the vehicle to be paid to the owner. The greater the\r\nvalue of the vehicle and the more quickly the matter is resolved the better the\r\nchance that there will be something left for the owner. Indeed owners who\r\nrecognise that the prospects of success on an application for the return of the\r\nvehicle are poor would be well-advised to make a timely concession, in order\r\nto keep the charges to a minimum.\r\n270. Taking all these factors into account we are quite satisfied that,\r\nproperly applied, the impounding regime strikes a fair balance between the\r\nrights of the individual vehicle owner and the interests of the State, on behalf\r\nof the public generally, in securing compliance with the system of operator’s\r\nlicencing in order to promote road safety and fair competition. For these\r\nreasons we can see no need to read down the provisions of the impounding\r\nregime in order to include an element of discretion. Indeed we find it difficult\r\nto envisage any circumstances in which after the failure of a claim for the\r\nreturn of a vehicle it would, nevertheless, be appropriate to exercise a\r\ndiscretion to return the vehicle.”\r\n39. The Nolan determination upon the issue of proportionality dealt with the\r\nreasons for the impounding regime being introduced and the impact of\r\nillegal operation prior to its implementation. It dealt with the Regulatory\r\nImpact Assessments and concluded that the documents produced to\r\nthe Tribunal demonstrated a strong public interest in the enforcement\r\nof s.2 of the 1995 Act. The case law was considered in detail. It\r\ndetermined rightly that the regime was well balanced and carefully\r\ncrafted and it recognised that it was a regime that needed “teeth”.\r\nWhilst the regime did not allow for a residual discretion it was one that\r\nprovided four grounds for making an application for return of a vehicle\r\nand critically one of them (paragraph 10(4)(a)) was that the operator\r\ndid not know that the vehicle was being operated unlawfully. That\r\nmeans that if that ground is not relied upon then an operator is\r\naccepting that he did know that his vehicle was being operated in\r\nbreach of s.2 of the 1995 Act. We would add that the fourth ground set\r\nout in paragraph 10(4)(d) of the 2001 Regulations allows for the return\r\nof a vehicle when an operator accepts that he knew that his vehicle\r\nwas or had been used in contravention of s.2 of the 1995 Act but had\r\ntaken steps with a view to preventing that use and had taken steps with\r\na view to preventing any further such use. That ground along with the\r\nground contained in paragraph 10(4)(a) represented substantial\r\nsafeguards to the wrongful impounding of a vehicle. In short, we agree\r\nwith the reasoning in Nolan as set out above and we are satisfied that\r\nBM have not established any compelling reason why this Tribunal\r\nshould come to a different view to that in Nolan. Further, we do not\r\nagree that the final sentence of paragraph 270 in Nolan is contrary to\r\nEuropean Convention principles. The impounding regime contains\r\nmany checks and balances throughout its process and we repeat, once\r\n23\r\nthe point has come when a decision is made not to return a vehicle to\r\nan operator, findings of fact will have been made that the operator\r\nknew that the vehicle was being operated in breach of s.2 of the 1995\r\nAct and had failed to satisfy a TC and/or the Tribunal that it satisfied\r\nthe ground contained in paragraph 10(4)(d) of the 2001 Regulations\r\njustifying the return of the vehicle (if that ground is relied upon).\r\n40. Even if we are wrong in refusing to include an element of discretion in\r\nthe impounding regime, by reason of the very poor enforcement history\r\nof Bolle Transport and Mr Bolle’s own knowledge of the cabotage\r\nbreaches identified by VOSA and/or the DVSA as set out in paragraphs\r\n4 and 5 above, we are satisfied that this is not a case where it would be\r\nappropriate to exercise a residual discretion in any event. The\r\nenforcement history of Bolle Transport is quite frankly, appalling. We\r\nhave asked ourselves the question: what steps could or should have\r\nbeen taken short of impounding a vehicle which might have caused\r\nBolle Transport to realise that it could not continue to blatantly flout the\r\ncabotage regime? VOSA and/or the DVSA have acted with\r\nextraordinary restraint in not invoking the impounding procedure before\r\n24 July 2015 and in the circumstances it would be wrong to return a\r\nvehicle based upon an assertion that the vehicle was impounded upon\r\na “technical breach” only. It is for Bolle Transport to organise the\r\nlogistics of its transport operations and to ensure that a tractor unit is\r\nattached to the correct trailer when it embarks on an international\r\njourney.\r\n41. The Tribunal’s decision on the appeal\r\nIn all of the circumstances we are satisfied that neither the law nor the\r\nfacts of this case impel us to come to a different view to that of the TC as\r\nper the test in Bradley Fold Travel Ltd & Peter Wright v Secretary of\r\nState for Transport (2010) EWCA Civ. 695.\r\n42. In the result, the appeal is dismissed.\r\nHer Honour Judge J Beech\r\n5 September 2016","tribunal_decision_categories":["transport-traffic-commissioner-and-doe-ni-appeals"],"tribunal_decision_decision_date":"2016-09-05","tribunal_decision_judges":["beech-j"],"tribunal_decision_sub_categories":["transport-traffic-commissioner-and-doe-ni-appeals-impounding","transport-traffic-commissioner-and-doe-ni-appeals-other"],"bulk_published":true},"max_cache_time":10,"temporary_update_type":false,"attachments":[{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57e29735ed915d6c2f00006c/T-2016-28_Bolle_Materieel_BV__3_.pdf","title":"T/28/2016","content_type":"application/pdf","updated_at":"2016-09-21T14:20:37+00:00","created_at":"2016-09-21T14:20:37+00:00","content_id":"d856b239-a967-414e-b739-d14b7dc133ed"}],"headers":[{"text":"Judicial Summary","level":2,"id":"judicial-summary"}],"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2016-12-01T16:20:30.236Z"}]},"routes":[{"path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions/bolle-materieel-bv-2016-ukut-398-aac","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"specialist-publisher","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"utaac_decision","schema_name":"specialist_document","first_published_at":"2016-12-01T16:20:30Z","base_path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions/bolle-materieel-bv-2016-ukut-398-aac","description":"Upper Tribunal Administrative Appeals Chamber decision by Judge Beech on 05 September 2016            \t\t\t\t\r\n","content_id":"df587761-e7d8-4f64-a54b-1e4e74261bcc","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"D18","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice","base_path":"/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice","content_id":"dcc907d6-433c-42df-9ffb-d9c68be5dc4d","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-07-18T17:26:49Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Ministry of Justice","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"ministry-of-justice","logo":{"formatted_title":"Ministry<br/>of Justice","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}},{"analytics_identifier":"EA73","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service","base_path":"/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service","content_id":"6f757605-ab8f-4b62-84e4-99f79cf085c2","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-02-21T14:12:20Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"HM Courts & Tribunals Service","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"ministry-of-justice","logo":{"formatted_title":"HM Courts &amp; <br/>Tribunals Service","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}},{"analytics_identifier":"PB1142","api_path":"/api/content/courts-tribunals/upper-tribunal-administrative-appeals-chamber","base_path":"/courts-tribunals/upper-tribunal-administrative-appeals-chamber","content_id":"4c2e325a-2d95-442b-856a-e7fb9f9e3cf8","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-06-18T16:08:53Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber)","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":null,"logo":{"formatted_title":"Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber)"}},"links":{}}],"finder":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions","base_path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions","content_id":"e9e7fcff-bb0d-4723-af25-9f78d730f6f8","description":"Find decisions on appeals to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber), including social security and child support appeals.","document_type":"finder","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-03-30T10:34:00Z","schema_name":"finder","title":"Administrative appeals tribunal decisions","withdrawn":false,"details":{"document_noun":"decision","filter":{"document_type":"utaac_decision"},"format_name":"Administrative appeals tribunal decision","show_summaries":true,"summary":"<p>Find decisions on appeals to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber), including social security and child support appeals.</p><p>This includes decisions made from January 2016 onwards.
