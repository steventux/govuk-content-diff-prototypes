On 25th June 2015, Mr Allan applied, as a sole trader, to the Traffic Commissioner\r\nfor the Scottish Traffic Area (“the Commissioner”) for a restricted public service\r\nvehicle operator’s licence. This application was made shortly after the withdrawal of a\r\nsimilar application made by a company of which he was a director ((JA Travel Scotia\r\nLtd). Ms Angela Luke the co-director of that company.\r\n2. Mr Allan’s application gave his home address as his proposed operating centre at\r\nwhich he intended to keep a single minibus although, subsequently, he informed the\r\nCommissioner that he had obtained commercial premises. Mr Allan also wrote that he\r\nworked as a taxi driver for 15 hours per week although, in response to DVSA\r\ninquiries, he said he only worked as a taxi driver for 6-8 hours a week.\r\n3. The DVSA case summary said this about Ms Luke:\r\n“Angela Luke…seems to be involved with the current application and has\r\nbeen the main contact. She is also the owner/operator of some of the vehicles\r\nmentioned in the responses concerning this application and account holder of\r\nthe financial evidence submitted. It is therefore still unclear if the current\r\napplication has been made in the correct entity”.\r\n4. By letter of 29th October 2015, the Office of the Traffic Commissioner (OTC)\r\ninformed Mr Allan that the Commissioner was not satisfied, on the basis of his\r\n[2016] UKUT 466 (AAC)\r\nT/2015/79\r\n3\r\nwritten application, that his application met the relevant regulatory requirements. Mr\r\nAllan requested that a public inquiry be held before his application was decided.\r\n5. The letter of 29th October 2015 drew Mr Allan’s attention to the OTC guide to\r\npublic inquiries and the Senior Traffic Commissioner’s statutory guidance and\r\ndirections on public inquiry proceedings.\r\n6. The public inquiry papers show that both Mr Allan and Ms Luke liaised with the\r\nOTC over the progress of his application. For example, on 31st July 2015 she supplied\r\nthe OTC with financial evidence in support of the application and also wrote “we no\r\nlonger require an extension of time”.\r\n7. However, Ms Luke was not treated as Mr Allan’s representative. On 25th August\r\n2015, in response to Ms Luke’s request for a progress report, an OTC official\r\ninformed her a letter had been sent to Mr Allan (stating the Commissioner was\r\nminded to refuse his application) inviting him, not Ms Luke, to contact the official if\r\nhe wished to discuss the matter. And on 25th August 2015 an official informed Ms\r\nLuke that she could not accept her emailed request for a public inquiry. Following\r\nthis, Mr Allan himself made a written request for a public inquiry on 31st August\r\n2015.\r\n8. On 6th November 2015 Mr Allan wrote to the OTC about his application, stating:\r\n“My partner Angela Luke does not and had never wanted to have anything to\r\ndo with the Operator’s Licence and only agreed to be a joint applicant with me\r\nas the first advice given was that it would be better to do a joint application as\r\nthe bank account was in joint names, this was resolved by completing a\r\nStatutory Declaration at the solicitors. Angela was acting as my contact for\r\nany and all things in relation to the Licence as I asked her to do so on my\r\nbehalf”.\r\n9. Despite that letter, Mr Allan did not request, before the public inquiry, that Ms\r\nLuke be permitted to speak on his behalf at the inquiry hearing.\r\n10. The transcript of the public inquiry, held on 3rd December 2015, lists three persons\r\nin attendance: the Commissioner, Mr Allan and a clerk. The transcript shows that the\r\nCommissioner said significantly more during the inquiry than did Mr Allan and, as\r\nshe was entitled to do, actively managed the proceedings. On p.25 of the 26 page\r\ntranscript the Commissioner said “Anyway, that is me having asked as many\r\nquestions as I think I can usefully ask of you”. Mr Allan responded “Right. No\r\nproblem. Right. Okay”.\r\nLegal framework\r\n[2016] UKUT 466 (AAC)\r\nT/2015/79\r\n4\r\n11. Section 12(1) of the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981 prohibits a public service\r\nvehicle from being used on a road to carry passengers for hire or reward except under\r\na PSV operators’ licence (hereafter, references to sections are to sections of the 1981\r\nAct) Section 13(1) creates two classes of PSV operators’ licence, standard and\r\nrestricted. By section 13(3), a restricted licence authorises:\r\n(a) use of public service vehicles not adapted to carry more than eight passengers; and\r\n(b) use of public service vehicles not adapted to carry more than sixteen passengers\r\nbut only if a further requirement is met. That requirement can be met in one of two\r\nways. Firstly, where a vehicle is not used in the course of a business of carrying\r\npassengers (not relevant in this case). Secondly, where a vehicle is used by “a person\r\nwhose main occupation is not the operation of public service vehicles adapted to carry\r\nmore than eight passengers”.\r\n12. Under section 14ZB, the requirements for restricted licences are that the applicant\r\nis “of good repute” and has “appropriate financial standing” (the content of those\r\nrequirements are specified in Schedule 3 to the 1981 Act). Under section 14ZC,\r\ncertain requirements apply to both restricted and standard licences. The traffic\r\ncommissioner must be satisfied there are adequate facilities or arrangements for\r\nvehicle maintenance, and adequate arrangements for securing compliance with the\r\nlaw about driving and operating public service vehicles.\r\n13. Regulation 6 of the Public Service Vehicles (Operator’ Licences) Regulations\r\n1995 provides:\r\n“A traffic commissioner shall not refuse an application for a licence…without\r\ngiving to the applicant an opportunity to state his case at an inquiry save where\r\nthe application or the applicant’s conduct in relation to it is frivolous or\r\nunreasonable”.\r\n14. The Senior Traffic Commissioner’s statutory guidance on case management deals\r\nwith representation at public inquiries. In relation to representatives, it states:\r\n“37…a traffic commissioner has a wide discretion as to the manner in which\r\ns/he conducts a hearing. Any person entitled or permitted to appear may do so\r\non his or her own behalf or can be represented by counsel…and/or a\r\nsolicitor…\r\n38. Other potential representatives such as transport consultants can only\r\nappear with the permission of the traffic commissioner. Whilst traffic\r\n[2016] UKUT 466 (AAC)\r\nT/2015/79\r\n5\r\ncommissioners generally allow unqualified advocates to appear before them\r\nthis is always at the discretion of the presiding traffic commissioner…”\r\nThe Traffic Commissioner’s decision\r\n15. On 14th December 2015, the Commissioner refused Mr Allan’s application. She\r\nfound that Mr Allan could not give a clear explanation of what the proposed licence\r\nwould be used for, had done little by way of business planning, had failed to\r\nappreciate the significance of the ‘principal occupation’ test and she was apprehensive\r\nthat PSV work might become Mr Allan’s principal occupation given how little taxi\r\nwork he had done recently. The Commissioner also expressed concern that, were a\r\nlicence granted, Mr Allan might allow someone else, specifically Ms Luke, to use it.\r\nDue to the “naivety, misunderstandings, the lack of clarity”, the Commissioner was\r\nnot satisfied proper arrangements were in place for compliance with the law about\r\ndriving and operating public service vehicles.\r\n16. In fact, the Commissioner made strong adverse findings. Her reasons state Mr\r\nAllan was “hopelessly vague as to what he would charge”, while he was candid about\r\nhis ignorance of the licensing regime “it should not fall to the Traffic Commissioner’s\r\npublic inquiry to spell out such basics” and “I do not think I have met an applicant\r\nwho by the stage of a Public Inquiry was so lacking in understanding”.\r\nProceedings before the Upper Tribunal\r\n17. We shall summarise Mr Allan’s extensive grounds of appeal which he drafted\r\nhimself and were, to a large extent, a re-run of his reasons why he thought he should\r\nbe granted an operator’s licence:\r\n(a) by the date of the public inquiry, he had arranged commercial premises for his\r\nproposed business (the Commissioner in fact took this into account);\r\n(b) he was working reduced hours as a taxi driver due to a temporary back problem\r\nbut it remained his principal occupation. The Commissioner was wrong to suspect\r\nPSV work might become his principal occupation;\r\n(c) the Commissioner wrongly found that a Billy McMaster operated taxis for which\r\nhe had been granted a licence. Mr McMaster was simply a partner in a company that\r\noperated a booking office and Ms Luke arranged operating the cars;\r\n(d) in response to the Commissioner’s finding that his business plans were hopelessly\r\nvague, he said he had decided on a pricing structure. He thought applying for a PSV\r\nlicence was similar to the process for applying for a taxi licence in that, once\r\nobtained, he could “learn on the job”;\r\n[2016] UKUT 466 (AAC)\r\nT/2015/79\r\n6\r\n(e) Mr Allan explained at length how he and Ms Luke had shared out responsibility\r\nfor his taxis while he was incapacitated with a back injury;\r\n(f) in response to the Commissioner’s finding that she could not recall hearing from\r\nan applicant who was “so lacking in understanding and could not give a clear picture\r\nof what the licence would be used for and…the principal occupation test”, he said he\r\nhad explained the type of work he hoped to do;\r\n(g) in response to the Commissioner’s concern that, were a licence granted, Mr Allan\r\nwould allow someone else to operate a PSV business under cover of the licence, this\r\nwas strongly refuted. The only reason Ms Luke had done some of his taxi work was\r\nbecause he was unable to do it himself due to his back injury and, in any event, she\r\nhad not “taken over” the licences and was recorded on them as “day to day manager”.\r\nAt the hearing before ourselves he produced a licence to that effect although it was\r\ndated 28th April 2016. Ms Luke was only involved in the earlier limited company\r\napplication because Mr Allan was wrongly advised by the OTC that this was\r\nnecessary because the business funds would be held in their joint bank account. Ms\r\nLuke was a successful business person in her own right and, had she wanted an\r\noperator’s licence, would have applied for one;\r\n(h) in response to the Commissioner’s finding that he lacked knowledge of the\r\nregulatory regime, he pointed out that he learnt about drivers’ hours and tachographs\r\non a CPC (Certificate of Professional Competence) course;\r\n(i) the Commissioner did not give him enough credit for the steps he had taken to\r\nlearn about PSV licencing after withdrawal of the first application.\r\n18. A further argument was put at the hearing before ourselves which was that the\r\nCommissioner had refused to let Ms Luke speak on Mr Allan’s behalf at the public\r\ninquiry.\r\n19. We decided to seek the Commissioner’s observations on this allegation and her\r\nresponse was supplied to Mr Allan. The Commissioner wrote that she recalled Ms\r\nLuke attending the hearing as an observer but she was seated in the public seats not at\r\nthe front table with Mr Allan and “at no time did he ask if Ms Luke could speak for\r\nhim or give evidence”.\r\n20. In response, Mr Allan maintained the transcript omitted parts of the discussion at\r\nthe inquiry and that what Ms Luke had actually done was put her hand up to indicate\r\nshe wanted to speak. We have decided not to make arrangements to listen to the\r\nrecording of the public inquiry. We consider it highly unlikely that the transcript was\r\n[2016] UKUT 466 (AAC)\r\nT/2015/79\r\n7\r\ninaccurate and, in any event, a recording would not reveal whether or not Ms Luke\r\nraised her hand to speak.\r\nConclusions\r\n21. We dismiss the appeal. Neither the Commissioner’s findings, nor her decision,\r\ncan be considered plainly wrong which is the test applied by the Upper Tribunal in\r\nthis type of appeal (Bradley Fold Travel Ltd & Anor v Secretary of State for\r\nTransport [2010] EWCA Civ 695, [2011] RTR 13). Indeed, many of the findings\r\nconcerning Mr Allan’s ignorance of the licensing regime are not seriously challenged.\r\n22. Various challenges are made to the Commissioner’s finding that she was\r\nconcerned about the involvement of Ms Luke in the proposed business, how he had\r\nshared out responsibility for his taxi business with others and the possibility of Mr\r\nAllan’s principal occupation becoming PSV work. However, the Commissioner’s\r\nfindings had a proper basis in the evidence. They were not plainly wrong. In any\r\nevent, on our reading the Commissioner’s findings in this respect were simply one\r\naspect of her more general finding that Mr Allan had little idea of what his legal\r\nresponsibilities would be if became a PSV operator, not that he wilfully intended to\r\nuse a licence improperly.\r\n23. We also reject the argument that, at the hearing, the Commissioner refused to let\r\nMs Luke speak on Mr Allan’s behalf. The allegation was not made in a detailed letter\r\nthat Mr Allan sent to the OTC shortly after the hearing even though he referred to\r\nhimself being tongue-tied at the inquiry hearing. It was also not made in Mr Allan’s\r\ngrounds of appeal. The transcript provides no support for the allegation nor does the\r\nTraffic Commissioner’s letter in which she comments on the allegation. Furthermore,\r\ndespite having been directed by the OTC to the Senior Traffic Commissioner’s public\r\ninquiry guidance before this inquiry, Mr Allan did not request that anyone represent\r\nhim at the hearing.\r\nMr E.
