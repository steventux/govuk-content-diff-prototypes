Mr Dransfield has applied to the Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal against the Firsttier\r\nTribunal’s decision.\r\nBackground: Mr Dransfield’s requests to the Information Commissioners’ Office (ICO)\r\n2. This section contains a summary of the disputed requests for information.\r\n30th December 2013\r\n3. By email of this date, Mr Dransfield asked the ICO why new guidelines concerning\r\nvexatious requests were not signed and dated.\r\n3rd January 2014\r\n4. On this date Mr Dransfield made three emailed requests:\r\n(a) one email requested the names of ICO staff who had attended “Common Purpose” training\r\nin the previous 10 years, and the total costs of such training;\r\n(b) one email requested invoices submitted to the ICO by two named barristers and tender\r\ndocuments concerning services provided to the ICO by a named barristers’ chambers. This\r\nemail also made a complaint that the ICO used unqualified barristers and objected to one of\r\nthose barristers referring to himself as ‘Tom’ rather than ‘Thomas’ which was said to be\r\ndisrespectful;\r\n(c) one email requested all invoices submitted to the ICO between October 2011 and\r\nDecember 2013 in respect of services provided by barristers at a named chambers.\r\n4th January 2014\r\n5. On this date Mr Dransfield made three emailed requests:\r\nAD v The Information Commissioner\r\n[2016] UKUT 0273 (AAC)\r\nGIA/246/2015 2\r\n(a) the first email requested the full names and job titles of all ICO staff, the “legal credentials”\r\nof all ICO solicitors, the “contract” between the ICO and the named set of barristers’ chambers\r\nreferred to above, all invoices submitted by barristers of that chambers from October 2011 to\r\nDecember 2012 (on a weekly basis), the “qualifications and credentials” of two named ICO\r\nstaff and all ICO Department heads; and copies of the ICO’s ISO 4000 & 9000 audits for the\r\nlast three years;\r\n(b) the second email requested all internal correspondence, emails and notes of telephone\r\nconversations between September 2011 and “April 30th” concerning the ICO’s vexatious\r\nrequests guidelines, as well as minutes of meetings about the guidelines;\r\n(c) the third email asked for an explanation of guidance referred to in an ICO report to a\r\nParliamentary inquiry and to identify Upper Tribunal decisions referred to in the report.\r\n5th January 2014\r\n6. On this date, Mr Dransfield made two emailed requests:\r\n(a) the first request was for the “minutes” of a presentation given by the Deputy ICO which Mr\r\nDransfield said would prove the existence of a conspiracy. This email also described the\r\npresentation as, at best, “hogwash” and, at worst, “an attempt to pervert the course of justice”;\r\n(b) the second request was for the minutes of the ICO’s 9th annual meeting, its full costs\r\nincluding details of who paid for wine and canapés, and how many people attended.\r\n7th January 2014\r\n7. On this date, Mr Dransfield made two emailed requests:\r\n(a) the first request was for a “copy of the ICO complaints/allegations of fraud procedures”;\r\n(b) the second request was for “full bio data” for a Deputy ICO and a “full list” of his legal\r\ncredentials.\r\n12th January 2014\r\n8. On this date, Mr Dransfield emailed a complaint about the composition of the “ICO Counsel\r\nCommittee” which he asserts also contains a request for information.\r\n16th January 2014\r\n9. On this date, Mr Dransfield emailed a request for the “Security Attendance Sign-in Sheet”\r\nfor a First-tier Tribunal hearing held on 14th January 2014.\r\nAD v The Information Commissioner\r\n[2016] UKUT 0273 (AAC)\r\nGIA/246/2015 3\r\n19th January 2014\r\n10. On this date, Mr Dransfield emailed a request to be informed of the number of ICO staff\r\nmembers who had resigned from ICO employment, giving as a reason for resignation stress\r\nassociated with another request made by Mr Dransfield\r\n21st January 2014\r\n11. On this date, Mr Dransfield emailed a request for any ICO reports connected with its\r\n“monitoring” of Devon County Council.\r\n12. The Information Commissioner refused to supply any of the information sought, relying on\r\nsection 14(1) Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA), a decision which remained unaltered\r\non an internal ICO review.\r\n13. Mr Dransfield complained to the ICO about its handling of his requests. His complaint was\r\nrejected.\r\n14. Mr Dransfield appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. His grounds were that (a) no person\r\n“applying a right and proper mind” could have decided his requests were vexatious; (b) the\r\nICO were complicit in “silent fraud”; (c) the ICO were wrong to rely on Judge Wikeley’s\r\ndecision in Dransfield v the Information Commissioner when it was under appeal to the Court\r\nof Appeal; (d) “breach of stare decisis, sub judice, due process and common sense”; (e) the\r\nICO failed to investigate his allegations of bad faith.\r\n15. The Information Commissioner resisted the appeal. He responded to Mr Dransfield’s\r\ngrounds in turn and argued that, more generally, his decision was in accordance with the law.\r\nHe relied on his decision notice which concluded that the requests were vexatious for a number\r\nof connected reasons: the receipt of 15 requests within 16 working days was a strong\r\nindication that “this is likely to cause a disproportionate or unjustified level of disruption,\r\nirritation or distress”; “unreasonable persistence”; “intransigence”; and “frequent or\r\noverlapping requests”.\r\nThe First-tier Tribunal’s decision\r\n16. The Tribunal held a hearing attended by Mr Dransfield and counsel for the ICO. In its\r\nstatement of reasons, the Tribunal said it “has put from its mind…the Appellant’s name or the\r\nhistory associated with his appeals”. The Tribunal also rejected Mr Dransfield’s ‘expert report’\r\nas to the meaning of “vexatious”.\r\n17. The Tribunal dismissed Mr Dransfield’s appeal. The nub of its reasoning was as follows:\r\nAD v The Information Commissioner\r\n[2016] UKUT 0273 (AAC)\r\nGIA/246/2015 4\r\n“this series of requests were vexatious because of the number and frequency of them,\r\ntheir overlapping nature, the tone of them and the lack of an obvious benefit that might\r\nbe derived from responding to any or all of them. The Appellant offered no\r\nexplaination about any benefit that might accrue from responding to them.”\r\nLegal framework, including the Court of Appeal’s decision in Dransfield v The\r\nInformation Commissioner & Devon County Council [2015] EWCA Civ 454\r\n18. The Court of Appeal’s decision, given after the First-tier Tribunal gave its decision, is the\r\nleading authority on the meaning of “vexatious request” in section 14 of the Freedom of\r\nInformation Act 2000. Section 14 deals with both vexatious and repeated requests.\r\n19. So far as vexatious requests are concerned, section 14(1) provides that “section 1(1) does\r\nnot oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the request is\r\nvexatious”. In other words, a public authority’s duty to respond to a request for information by\r\ninforming the requester whether information of the description specified in the request and, if\r\nso, to communicate the information to the requester is disapplied in relation to any vexatious\r\nrequest.\r\n20. Section 14(2) deals with repeated requests. It applies where a public authority has\r\npreviously complied with a person’s request for information. It has not been argued that\r\nsection 14(2) applies in this case.\r\n21. I should also mention the general time-limits for a public authority to comply with a\r\nrequest for information. Section 14(1) provides that the authority must comply “promptly and\r\nin any event not later than the twentieth working day following the date of receipt”.\r\nAccordingly, the Act envisages that, before a request has been complied with, further requests\r\nmight be made. This happened here. All of Mr Dransfield’s subsequent requests were made\r\nwithin twenty working days of his first request.\r\n22. To put the Court of Appeal’s decision in context, I need to explain the Upper Tribunal\r\ndecision under appeal. This was Dransfield v the Information Commissioner [2012] UKUT\r\n440 (AAC) and it arose from a single request for information in relation to a certain bridge and\r\nits lightning protection system. This decision was made before the First-tier Tribunal gave its\r\ndecision. Certain aspects of Upper Tribunal Judge Wikeley’s reasons for his decision, and the\r\ngeneral guidance he gave, were not disputed before the Court of Appeal, including:\r\n(a) the question is not whether the requester is vexatious; it is whether the request is\r\nvexatious;\r\n(b) a request which is annoying or irritating to the recipient may be vexatious, but that\r\nis not a rule. Annoying or irritating requests are not necessarily vexatious;\r\n(c) a useful “starting point” was the Information Commissioner’s guidance - “the key\r\nquestion is whether the request is likely to cause distress, disruption or irritation,\r\nAD v The Information Commissioner\r\n[2016] UKUT 0273 (AAC)\r\nGIA/246/2015 5\r\nwithout any proper or justified cause” – so long as it was remembered to place\r\nemphasis on justification:\r\n(d) “a single abusive and offensive request may well cause distress, and so be vexatious\r\nwithin section 14, applying the ordinary meaning of the word. A torrent of individually\r\nbenign requests may well cause disruption, so one further such request may also be\r\nvexatious in the FOIA sense. However, for the reason noted in the previous paragraph,\r\nit may be more difficult to construe a request which merely causes irritation, without\r\nmore, as vexatious under section 14. Thus an important aspect of the balancing\r\nexercise may involve consideration of whether or not there is an adequate or proper\r\njustification for the request”;\r\n(e) Judge Wikeley went on to give guidance about identifying a vexatious request. The\r\nCourt of Appeal observed that this guidance was not challenged before it. The\r\nguidance identified four relevant considerations: (i) burden (to include “number,\r\nbreadth, pattern and duration of previous requests”); (ii) motive; (iii) “value or serious\r\npurpose”; (iv) “causing harassment of, or distress to, staff”.\r\n23. Arden LJ, who gave the principal judgment in the Court of Appeal, found as follows:\r\n(a) the “precise issue” on Mr Dransfield’s appeal was whether “past requests are\r\nrelevant only if they taint or infect the request which is said to be vexatious”;\r\n(b) on its face, Mr Dransfield’s request was not vexatious;\r\n(c) “there must be some limits on the ability to look at past dealings in this situation”\r\nand “even if the requester has made vexatious requests in the past, there must always\r\nbe the possibility that, on this occasion, the requester…may be making a request that\r\nneeds to be heeded, and that the request is for information that ought to be disclosed to\r\nachieve the statutory objective. The requester is after all exercising an important\r\nstatutory right”;\r\n(d) while “the term “misuse” of rights” is a useful expression for the purpose of\r\nidentifying “a badge of vexatiousness on the particular facts of a case” it “cannot be a\r\ncriterion for vexatiousness” because it lacks any precise definition;\r\n(e) a “comprehensive or exhaustive definition” could not be given because it was\r\n“better to allow the meaning of the phrase to be winnowed out in cases that arise”;\r\n(f) “the emphasis should be on an objective standard and that the starting point is that\r\nvexatiousness primarily involves making a request which has no reasonable foundation,\r\nthat is, no reasonable foundation for thinking that the information sought would be of\r\nvalue to the requester, or to the public or any section of the public. Parliament has\r\nchosen a strong word which therefore means that the hurdle of satisfying it is a high\r\none, and that is consistent with the constitutional nature of the right. The decisionmaker\r\nshould consider all the relevant circumstances in order to reach a balanced\r\nAD v The Information Commissioner\r\n[2016] UKUT 0273 (AAC)\r\nGIA/246/2015 6\r\nconclusion as to whether a request is vexatious. If it happens that a relevant motive can\r\nbe discerned with a sufficient degree of assurance, it may be evidence from which\r\nvexatiousness can be inferred. If a requester pursues his rights against an authority out\r\nof vengeance for some other decision of its, it may be said that his actions were\r\nimproperly motivated but it may also be that his request was without any reasonable\r\nfoundation. But this could not be said, however vengeful the requester, if the request\r\nwas aimed at the disclosure of important information which ought to be made publicly\r\navailable”;\r\n(g) the First-tier Tribunal had misconstrued section 14(1) in finding that the only prior\r\nrequests that could be taken into account in assessing whether the instant request was\r\nvexatious were those that “infected” the request. This contravened the “rounded”\r\napproach call for by the Act. Arden LJ went on:\r\n“It involved drawing bright lines between requests which spring from some\r\ncommon underlying grievance and those which, for example, relate to the same\r\nsubject matter although there is no underlying grievance in common. This\r\ndistinction is difficult to justify in logic and there is no statutory mandate for it.\r\nIf the F-tT were right, the decision-maker may have to disregard other evidence\r\nwhich may throw light on whether a request is vexatious, just as the F-tT left\r\nout of account the evidence in relation to prior requests that had led abuse and\r\nunsubstantiated allegations, of which the authority had first-hand knowledge\r\nbecause they had been directed to the authority’s staff.”\r\n(h) earlier requests that the First-tier Tribunal left out of account, described by the\r\nCourt as abusive and involving unsubstantiated allegations, were “clearly capable of\r\nthrowing light on whether the current request directed to the same matter was not an\r\ninquiry into health and safety but (say) a campaign conducted to gain personal\r\nsatisfaction out of the burdens it imposed on the authority”.\r\nThe course of the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal\r\n24. Having been refused permission to appeal by the First-tier Tribunal against its decision, Mr\r\nDransfield applied to the Upper Tribunal for permission. His grounds of appeal were:\r\n(a) “no person applying a right and proper mind could have reached such a decision”:\r\n(b) section 77 of FOIA 2000 has been breached;\r\n(c) the First-tier Tribunal erred in law by hearing the appeal while the Court of\r\nAppeal’s decision in Dransfield was pending;\r\n(d) the First-tier Tribunal erred in law “by not identifying first time FOI request”.\r\n25. By subsequent email, Mr Dransfield requested an oral hearing of his application.\r\nAD v The Information Commissioner\r\n[2016] UKUT 0273 (AAC)\r\nGIA/246/2015 7\r\n26. On 17th April 2015, I issued directions staying the proceedings pending the Court of\r\nAppeal’s decision. Mr Dransfield by email of 22nd April 2015 informed the Upper Tribunal that\r\nhe agreed with the direction to stay the proceedings.\r\n27. On 8th September 2015, I gave directions lifting the stay of proceedings and inviting the\r\nparties to make written submissions on the implications for this application of the Court of\r\nAppeal’s decision. Mr Dransfield objected by letter received on 5th October 2015 because that\r\ndecision was “currently before the Supreme Court”. However, the Supreme Court\r\nsubsequently refused him permission to appeal to it against the Court of Appeal’s decision.\r\n28. On 10th February 2016, I issued directions informing the parties that I proposed to strike\r\nout Mr Dransfield’s application on the basis that it appeared not to have a reasonable prospect\r\nof success, and to do so without holding a hearing. The parties were invited to make written\r\nrepresentations on that (provisional) proposal.\r\n29. On 17th February 2016, the Upper Tribunal received Mr Dransfield’s written\r\nrepresentations. He asserted the Upper Tribunal had no power to strike out without holding a\r\nhearing. He also argued that all of the instant requests were new requests and so the Court of\r\nAppeal’s decision “had no standing” and added:\r\n“At best your letter is HOGWASH and at worst it is designed to pervert the Course of\r\nJustice. I suggest the latter. There is no doubt in my mind the UT are complicit with all\r\nthis Vexatious BS and you are hell bent on gagging Joe Public, so strike me out if you\r\nso wish”.\r\n30. On 19th February 2016, the ICO made written representations arguing that the appeal had\r\nno reasonable prospect of success and in so doing adopted my provisional views of 10th\r\nFebruary 2016.\r\nConclusion\r\nLegal framework\r\n31. Rule 8(3)(c) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 confers power on the\r\nUpper Tribunal to strike out the whole or part of “proceedings which are not an appeal from\r\nthe decision of another tribunal or judicial review proceedings” if “the Upper Tribunal\r\nconsiders there is no reasonable prospect of the appellant's…case, or part of it, succeeding”.\r\nThe present matter is not an appeal – it is an application for permission to appeal – and so the\r\npower in rule 8(3)(c) is potentially available. However, the Tribunal may not strike out\r\nproceedings without giving the applicant “an opportunity to make representations in relation to\r\nthe proposed striking out”. That opportunity has been given.\r\n32. Rule 34(1) provides that the Upper Tribunal “may make any decision without a hearing”,\r\nalthough rule 34(2) provides that the Tribunal “must have regard to any view expressed by a\r\nparty when deciding whether to hold a hearing to consider any matter”.\r\nAD v The Information Commissioner\r\n[2016] UKUT 0273 (AAC)\r\nGIA/246/2015 8\r\n33. The overriding objective of the Upper Tribunal Rules is to enable the Tribunal to deal with\r\ncases fairly and justly (rule 2(1)). That includes “dealing with the case in ways which are\r\nproportionate to the importance of the case, the complexity of the issues, the anticipated costs\r\nand the resources of the parties” and “ensuring, so far as practicable, that the parties are able to\r\nparticipate fully in the proceedings”. The overriding objective must be taken into account by\r\nthe Tribunal when it exercises any power under the Rules or interprets a rule.\r\n34. The power to strike out the proceedings on an application for permission to appeal must be\r\nexercised with caution since it is a denial of access to appellate justice.\r\n35. Upper Tribunal Judge Jacobs in AD v Information Commissioner & Devon County\r\nCouncil [2013] UKUT 0550 (AAC) considered the First-tier Tribunal’s use of the strike-out\r\npower in an information rights case. He made the point that “all aspects of the overriding\r\nobjective have to be taken into account when a tribunal is considering exercising its power to\r\nstrike out”. That applies equally to the Upper Tribunal’s exercise of its strike-out power since\r\nits procedural rules are, in material respects, constructed in the same way as the First-tier\r\nTribunal’s. However, there is a contextual difference in that, where the applicant seeks\r\npermission to appeal against the First-tier Tribunal’s determination of the merits of an appeal,\r\ns/he has already had the benefit of a judicial adjudication of his/her right to the information\r\nrequested.\r\n36. Judge Jacobs also made the important points, by reference to Court of Appeal authorities,\r\nthat the strike-out power:\r\n(a) must be used for legitimate case management purposes, not for some other purpose;\r\n(b) should not be exercised unless the tribunal has considered whether its other case\r\nmanagement powers could be used to arrive at a more just result;\r\n(c) since it is a method of “final disposal”, should only be used as a “last resort”.\r\n37. Upper Tribunal Judge Wikeley in AW v the Information Commissioner & Blackpool CC\r\n[2013] UKUT 030 (AAC) also considered the First-tier Tribunal’s use of its strike-out power\r\nin an information rights case. I shall quote his helpful description of the development and\r\npurpose of the power to strike out proceedings:\r\n“7. It is important to consider issues of first principle. It is well established in the\r\nordinary courts that the historic justification for striking out a claim is that the\r\nproceedings are an abuse of process (see e.g. Hunter v Chief Constable of West\r\nMidlands Police [1982] AC 529 at 541B per Lord Diplock). On that basis, the power\r\nshould only be exercised in plain and obvious cases (see Lonrho PLC v Fayed [1990] 2\r\nQB 479 at 489F-G per Dillon LJ and 492G-H per Ralph Gibson LJ).\r\n8. More recent rulings from the superior courts point to the need to look at the\r\ninterests of justice as a whole (see e.g. Swain v Hillman [2011] 1 All ER 91). It is also\r\nwell established that striking out is a draconian power of last resort: see Biguzzi v Rank\r\nAD v The Information Commissioner\r\n[2016] UKUT 0273 (AAC)\r\nGIA/246/2015 9\r\nLeisure plc [1999] 1 WLR 1926 at 1933B per Lord Woolf MR (where, admittedly, the\r\nissue was delay rather than lack of reasonable prospects) and also, in the Upper\r\nTribunal, AS v Buckinghamshire CC (SEN) [2011] AACR 20 and [2010] UKUT 407\r\n(AAC) at [14]. It is, moreover, plainly a decision which involves a balancing exercise\r\nand the exercise of a judicial discretion, taking into account in particular the\r\nrequirements of Rule 2 of the GRC Rules [the overriding objective provisions].\r\n9. So what then is meant by saying that “there is no reasonable prospect of the\r\nappellant’s case, or part of it, succeeding” (within rule 8(3)(c))? The standard and\r\nauthoritative commentary on tribunal procedure, by Judge Edward Jacobs (Tribunal\r\nPractice and Procedure, 2nd edn, 2011, at [12.39]), advises that this “is only\r\nappropriate if the outcome of the case is, realistically and for practical purposes, clear\r\nand incontestable…”\r\nWhy I strike out this application\r\n38. I have decided to strike out Mr Dransfield’s application for permission to appeal, and to do\r\nso without directing a hearing. I do so for the following reasons.\r\n39. Mr Dransfield’s appeal is without merit. The outcome, were permission to appeal granted,\r\nwould be “clear and incontestable”. Mr Dransfield’s appeal would not succeed. His grounds of\r\nappeal do not have even a remote prospect of success:\r\n(a) the argument that “no person applying a right and proper mind could have reached\r\nsuch a decision [that all his requests were vexatious]” cannot succeed. The First-tier\r\nTribunal did not have the benefit of the Court of Appeal’s decision in Dransfield.\r\nHowever, neither that Court’s rulings about the nature of a “vexatious request” nor\r\nthose elements of Judge Wikeley’s decision that were not disputed before the Court\r\nprovide any support for the argument that the Tribunal’s decision was irrational or\r\nperverse. The factors taken into account by the First-tier Tribunal were legitimate\r\nconsiderations in the light of those decisions and were all adequately supported by the\r\nevidence before the Tribunal. Taking those factors in turn:\r\n(i) the number and frequency of the requests was a legitimate consideration. As\r\nJudge Wikeley said in his guidance, a “torrent of individually benign requests” can\r\njustify a finding that the requests are vexatious. And, as Arden LJ held, there is no\r\nrule that only those requests that “infect” another request may be taken into\r\naccount in assessing whether that request is vexatious;\r\n(ii) the overlapping nature of the requests was a legitimate consideration. As Judge\r\nWikeley said, the pattern of requests may be taken into account;\r\n(iii) the tone of certain of the requests was a legitimate consideration. While there\r\nis probably only one request that can properly be described as rude (that which\r\nincluded a description of a presentation given by a Deputy Information\r\nAD v The Information Commissioner\r\n[2016] UKUT 0273 (AAC)\r\nGIA/246/2015 10\r\nCommissioner as “hogwash”), the Tribunal was certainly entitled, looking at the\r\nset of requests as a package, to place adverse reliance on the tone of the requests;\r\n(iv) the finding that there was a lack of an obvious benefit that might be derived\r\nfrom any of the requests can, I accept, be criticised on the ground that, standing\r\nalone, certain of the requests might have generated some benefit for Mr Dransfield\r\nby helping him better to understand the ICO’s then practice in applying section 14.\r\nHowever, there were many requests in respect of which the finding of a lack of\r\nobvious benefit was entirely justified. For example, the request relating to the full\r\nfirst name of a particular barrister and for details of who paid for wine and canapés\r\nat a particular ICO event. Since this was but one factor relied on by the First-tier\r\nTribunal, its blanket categorisation of all requests as lacking any obvious benefit\r\ndoes not come close to demonstrating an arguable material error of law in the\r\nTribunal’s decision and certainly does not demonstrate perversity as Mr Dransfield\r\neffectively argues;\r\n(v) the absence of any explanation on Mr Dransfield’s part as to the benefit that\r\nmight accrue from disclosure of the information sought was a legitimate\r\nconsideration. As Arden LJ held, “the starting point is that vexatiousness primarily\r\ninvolves making a request which has no reasonable foundation”;\r\n(b) the ground which relies on an asserted breach of section 77 of FOIA 2000 has no\r\nmerit. Section 77 criminalises certain conduct, such as alteration of records, in response\r\nto a request for information where it is done with the intention of preventing disclosure\r\nof information to which the requester would have been entitled. Mr Dransfield put\r\nforward no remotely plausible evidence to the First-tier Tribunal to indicate that the\r\nInformation Commissioner, or a member of staff, had altered information, or done any\r\nof the other prohibited acts, with the intention of preventing disclosure;\r\n(c) the ground that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law by deciding the appeal while the\r\nCourt of Appeal’s decision in Dransfield was pending has no merit. The First-tier\r\nTribunal was entitled not to stay the proceedings. In the circumstances, it was not\r\nbound to conclude that the outcome of Dransfield was likely to have a material\r\ninfluence on the appeal. In any event, Mr Dransfied has not explained how the Court of\r\nAppeal’s decision, had it been given before the First-tier Tribunal’s decision, might\r\nhave affected the outcome;\r\n(d) the bare assertion that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law “by not identifying first\r\ntime FOI request” has no merit. The fact that a request is not a duplicate request does\r\nnot immunise it from a finding that it is vexatious.\r\n40. I ask myself whether exercising the power to strike-out Mr Dransfield’s application would\r\nbe for a legitimate case management purpose and whether it would be in accordance with the\r\noverriding objective of dealing with cases fairly and justly, including in particular “dealing with\r\nthe case in ways which are proportionate to the importance of the case, the complexity of the\r\nAD v The Information Commissioner\r\n[2016] UKUT 0273 (AAC)\r\nGIA/246/2015 11\r\nissues, the anticipated costs and the resources of the parties” and “ensuring, so far as\r\npracticable, that the parties are able to participate fully in the proceedings”.\r\n41. I recognise that, by striking-out Mr Dransfield’s application, rather than refusing\r\npermission to appeal on the papers, I deprive him of the chance under rule 22(4) of the Upper\r\nTribunal Rules to have his application reconsidered at a hearing (the rule does not confer in\r\nterms a right to such a hearing but the Administrative Appeal Chamber’s practice is to grant a\r\nrequest for reconsideration and I know of no case in which it has been refused). The right to\r\napply for oral reconsideration only applies where, in certain cases, the Upper Tribunal\r\ndetermines an application for permission to appeal.\r\n42. However, the case management consequence of a decision to strike out an application for\r\npermission to appeal is not something I am obliged to avoid, especially where an application\r\ndoes not have even a remote prospect of success. The Upper Tribunal does not have unlimited\r\nresources. A hearing incurs financial and other costs and also delays the hearing of some other\r\ncase. I also take into account that the Upper Tribunal’s rules anticipate the possibility of\r\nstriking-out an application which, if simply refused on the papers, would allow the applicant to\r\nseek an oral reconsideration. The rules do not disapply the power to strike out in a case where,\r\nhad permission to appeal been refused on the papers, the Appellant would have the right to\r\nseek an oral reconsideration. For certain immigration decisions, rule 34(3) requires a hearing\r\nbefore “disposing” of the case. And so the makers of the Rules identified certain categories of\r\ncase where a hearing would always be required. But the Rules do not, in the same way, treat as\r\na special case an application for permission to appeal against an information rights decision of\r\nthe First-tier Tribunal.\r\n43. Striking-out Mr Dransfield’s application is neither unfair nor unjust. It might be if he had\r\neven a remote prospect of success but he does not and, of course, he has already had the\r\nbenefit of a judicial determination of his rights to the information requested.\r\n44. Striking-out the application is not a disproportionate response having regard to the case’s\r\nimportance, complexity and the anticipated costs and resources of the parties. The case is not\r\nof general importance. Mr Dransfield principally seeks information about how the ICO\r\napproached section 14 FOIA but at a time before the Court of Appeal gave what is now the\r\nleading decision on the section. He also seeks information in relation to the competence of ICO\r\nstaff, its use of external legal services and its “monitoring” of Devon County Council but\r\nwithout there being any indication that the ICO might be remiss in those respects. I am sure Mr\r\nDransfield is of the view that the case is very important to him but the fact remains that his\r\nprincipal aim seems to be to illuminate the ICO’s approach to applying section 14 at a time\r\nbefore the Court of Appeal gave what is now the leading decision on section 14. The\r\ncomplexity of the case seems to me to have little relevance to striking out a case such as this\r\nwithout even a remote prospect of success. The anticipated costs and resources of the parties\r\nsupply no weight in Mr Dransfield’s favour. He is representing himself and it is obvious that he\r\nis more than au fait with FOIA. On the other hand, the ICO is a public authority with finite\r\nresources and striking-out the application will reduce the costs it incurs in resisting an\r\napplication that is without merit.\r\nAD v The Information Commissioner\r\n[2016] UKUT 0273 (AAC)\r\nGIA/246/2015 12\r\n45. I am also satisfied that Mr Dransfield has been able to participate fully in the proceedings.\r\nHe is clearly familiar with FOIA and has been given the opportunity to make representations\r\nagainst the proposed striking-out of his application. I do not consider that, were his application\r\nto proceed to an oral hearing of the proposed strike-out, or his application for permission to\r\nappeal, he would be able to participate more fully in the proceedings. In his written\r\nrepresentations, Mr Dransfield did not argue that he would be able better to present his case at\r\na hearing. He simply asserted that the Upper Tribunal had no power to strike-out his\r\napplication without holding a hearing.\r\n46. I have considered whether the exercise of some other case management power would be a\r\nmore just way to proceed. But there is no case management power that could convert his\r\nhopeless case into a case with arguable merit.\r\n47. For the above reasons, I refuse to direct a hearing of the proposed striking-out of Mr\r\nDransfield’s application and, having found that there is not a reasonable prospect of his case\r\nsucceeding, I decide to strike out the proceedings on his application in their entirety.\r\n(Signed on the original) E Mitchell\r\nJudge of the Upper Tribunal\r\n(Dated) 5th May 2016\r\nThese reasons were corrected on 2nd June 2016 under rule 42 of the Tribunal Procedure\r\n(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 for the purposes of correcting typographical errors and reformatting.","tribunal_decision_categories":["information-rights","tribunal-procedure-and-practice"],"tribunal_decision_decision_date":"2016-05-05","tribunal_decision_judges":["mitchell-e"],"tribunal_decision_sub_categories":["information-rights-freedom-of-information-absolute-exemptions","tribunal-procedure-and-practice-leave-permission-to-appeal"],"bulk_published":true},"max_cache_time":10,"temporary_update_type":false,"attachments":[{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/578f2b5aed915d3cfd000179/GIA_0246_2015-00.pdf","title":"GIA/246/2015","content_type":"application/pdf","updated_at":"2016-07-20T07:42:18Z","created_at":"2016-07-20T07:42:18Z","content_id":"7ca35a82-a638-4cea-b977-7fdae3e39e9b"}],"headers":[{"text":"Judicial Summary","level":2,"id":"judicial-summary"}],"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2016-12-01T16:20:22.440Z"}]},"routes":[{"path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions/ad-v-the-information-commissioner-2016-ukut-273-aac","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"specialist-publisher","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"utaac_decision","schema_name":"specialist_document","first_published_at":"2016-12-01T16:20:22Z","base_path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions/ad-v-the-information-commissioner-2016-ukut-273-aac","description":"Upper Tribunal Administrative Appeals Chamber decision by Judge Mitchell on 5 May 2016.\r\n","content_id":"9f2368c9-ab99-42f0-b182-0c5666076309","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"D18","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice","base_path":"/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice","content_id":"dcc907d6-433c-42df-9ffb-d9c68be5dc4d","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-07-18T17:26:49Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Ministry of Justice","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"ministry-of-justice","logo":{"formatted_title":"Ministry<br/>of Justice","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}},{"analytics_identifier":"EA73","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service","base_path":"/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service","content_id":"6f757605-ab8f-4b62-84e4-99f79cf085c2","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-02-21T14:12:20Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"HM Courts & Tribunals Service","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"ministry-of-justice","logo":{"formatted_title":"HM Courts &amp; <br/>Tribunals Service","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}},{"analytics_identifier":"PB1142","api_path":"/api/content/courts-tribunals/upper-tribunal-administrative-appeals-chamber","base_path":"/courts-tribunals/upper-tribunal-administrative-appeals-chamber","content_id":"4c2e325a-2d95-442b-856a-e7fb9f9e3cf8","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-06-18T16:08:53Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber)","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":null,"logo":{"formatted_title":"Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber)"}},"links":{}}],"finder":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions","base_path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions","content_id":"e9e7fcff-bb0d-4723-af25-9f78d730f6f8","description":"Find decisions on appeals to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber), including social security and child support appeals.","document_type":"finder","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-03-30T10:34:00Z","schema_name":"finder","title":"Administrative appeals tribunal decisions","withdrawn":false,"details":{"document_noun":"decision","filter":{"document_type":"utaac_decision"},"format_name":"Administrative appeals tribunal decision","show_summaries":true,"summary":"<p>Find decisions on appeals to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber), including social security and child support appeals.</p><p>This includes decisions made from January 2016 onwards.
