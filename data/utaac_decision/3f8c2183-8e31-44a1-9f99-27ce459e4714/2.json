This is a driving instructor’s appeal against a decision of a First-tier Tribunal (FTT)\r\nmade on 9 March 2016. For the reasons referred to below that decision was in my judgment\r\nwrong in law. I allow the appeal, set aside the FTT’s decision and remit the matter for\r\nredetermination by an entirely differently constituted FTT. In connection with that\r\nredetermination I DIRECT as follows:\r\n(1) The Appellant must sent to the First-tier Tribunals Service, within one\r\nmonth from the date of issue of this decision, any additional documentation on which\r\nhe intends to rely at the rehearing.\r\n(2) After the expiry of that one month period the appeal shall come before a\r\nJudge of the First-tier Tribunal for consideration whether to direct that any additional\r\nevidence be obtained.\r\n2. I gave permission to appeal following an oral hearing of the application for\r\npermission on 6 June 2016, at which the Appellant appeared in person and the Registrar\r\nwas represented (as he had been before the FTT) by Mrs Turland, an employee of the\r\nDriver and Vehicle Standards Agency. Since the grant of permission I have received a short\r\nwritten submission in the appeal from the Registrar. I have not considered it necessary to\r\ninvite the Appellant to respond, or to hold a hearing of the appeal itself.\r\n3. The FTT’s decision was to dismiss the Appellant’s appeal against a decision of the\r\nRespondent, notified to the Appellant on 16 November 2015, refusing the Appellant’s\r\napplication for re-registration as an approved driving instructor.\r\n4. Appeal to the Upper Tribunal from the FTT’s decision lies only on the ground of error\r\nof law by the First-tier Tribunal.\r\nThe facts\r\n5. The Appellant is a man now aged 51 whose name was first entered on the Register\r\nin May 2011. His name was removed from the Register on 1 June 2015, following expiry of\r\nhis certificate of registration by effluxion of time on the last day of May 2015. He told me at\r\nthe hearing that his registration expired because, owing to the time which it took to obtain a\r\nDisclosure and Barring Service Certificate, for which he had applied on 22 March 2015, he\r\nwas unable to apply for reregistration prior to the expiry of his registration.\r\n6. (Mrs Turland informed me at the hearing of the application for permission that the\r\nRegistrar writes to registered instructors 7 months before the expiry of their registration,\r\nadvising them that the process of obtaining a DBS certificate may take several months. If an\r\napplicant can show that he has applied for a DBS certificate in good time – i.e. not less than\r\n3 months before the expiry of the registration - but the certificate has nevertheless not\r\narrived by the time of the expiry of the registration, the Registrar will provide the applicant\r\nwith a letter which will prevent him from being prosecuted for continuing to give paid driving\r\ninstruction whilst unregistered, if the delay in obtaining reregistration is due to the delay in\r\nobtaining the DBS certificate).\r\n7. In the event the Applicant’s DBS certificate was not issued until 28 September 2015.\r\nHe applied for reregistration on 5 October 2015. His DBS certificate, and his completed\r\napplication for re-registration, disclosed convictions in April 2001 for failing to provide a\r\nspecimen for analysis and failing to provide a specimen of breath, for which he was\r\nAC v The Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors\r\n[2016] UKUT 0305 (AAC)\r\nGT/978/2016 2\r\ndisqualified from driving for 18 months. More significantly for present purposes, it also\r\ndisclosed a conviction on 28 April 2014 for driving a motor vehicle with excess alcohol,\r\ncontrary to s.5(1)(a) of the Road Traffic Act 1988, for which the sentence was a fine of\r\n£260, costs of £85 and victim surcharge of £20.\r\n8. On 6 October 2015 the Registrar wrote to the Appellant asking whether he wished to\r\nprovide any information in relation to the convictions, and for an explanation as to why he\r\nhad not notified the Registrar within 7 days of the 2014 conviction, as he had undertaken to\r\ndo in his original application for registration, dated 3 May 2011.\r\n9. The Appellant replied by email dated 8 October 2015, stating the circumstances of\r\nthe 2014 conviction. This email is set out in full in para. 14 of the FTT’s decision. The\r\nessence of it is that he said that his cousin had driven him and his family to a restaurant,\r\nand parked in the restaurant car park. The Appellant after eating and drinking felt sick, and\r\ncame out to the car to collect his jacket, but decided to stay in the car and wait for his\r\ncousin to drive them home. He sat in the driver’s seat and switched on the engine in order\r\nto get the heating going, which involved depressing the clutch, and whilst he was sitting\r\nthere with the engine running the police arrived in relation to an incident which did not\r\ninvolve him or his family, and when questioning him smelt alcohol on his breath. He had no\r\nintention of driving the car.\r\n“I was charged to court and was convicted of having excess alcohol but not drink driving\r\nbecause I DID NOT DRIVE THE CAR because the car was parked in the restaurant car park\r\nby my cousin and while I was in the car it DIDN’T MOVE FROM ITS ORIGINAL PARKED\r\nPOSITION by my cousin.”\r\nIn relation to the failure to inform the Registrar of the conviction he said that he thought he\r\nonly had to inform the Registrar if he got an endorsement on his driving licence.\r\n10. The contention that he had not been convicted of “drink driving” flatly contradicted\r\nboth what he had said on his application for registration and what was stated on the DBS\r\ncertificate.\r\n11. By letter from the Registrar dated 16 November 2015 the Appellant was informed\r\nthat his application for reregistration had been refused because the Registrar could not be\r\nsatisfied that he was a fit and proper person to have his name entered on the register, as\r\nrequired by s.125(3)(e) of the Road Traffic Act 1988. The letter stated:\r\n“He came to this conclusion because of your conviction which you failed to declare\r\non 28 April 2014 for driving a motor vehicle with excess alcohol ……..”\r\n12. The Appellant appealed to the FTT. In his response to the appeal the Registrar set\r\nout his reasons for refusal in more detail, as set out verbatim in para. 21 of the FTT’s\r\ndecision.\r\n13. In the course of the appeal the Appellant submitted page 1 of a document headed\r\n“MEMORANDUM of an ENTRY entered in the REGISTER of the South London Magistrates’\r\nCourt” for 6 August 2014. It states that the Appellant pleaded guilty on 28 April 2014 to the\r\nfollowing offence: “on 13 April 2014 at ……. drove a motor vehicle namely [the Appellant’s\r\ncar] on a public place, namely car park of [ ] restaurant ……… after consuming so\r\nmuch alcohol that the proportion of it in your breath, namely 62 microgrammes of alcohol in\r\n100 millilitres of breath, exceeded the prescribed limit”, contrary to s.5(1)(a) of the 1988 Act.\r\nThe document appears to state that the Defendant was present and represented by a\r\nAC v The Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors\r\n[2016] UKUT 0305 (AAC)\r\nGT/978/2016 3\r\nsolicitor. Under the heading “NDSR” (which I assume to stand for “no driving disqualification\r\nspecial reasons”) it states:\r\n“No obligatory driving disqualification. Special reasons. No disqualification – Special reasons\r\nfound based on shortness of distance – most importantly we found there was no intention to\r\ndrive and the distance driven was very short indeed.”\r\n14. The explanation for the reference to ‘special reasons’ is, no doubt, that section 34(1)\r\nof the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 provides:\r\n“Where a person is convicted of an offence involving obligatory disqualification the Court\r\nmust order him to be disqualified for such period not less than twelve months as the Court\r\nthinks fit unless the Court for special reasons thinks fit to order him to be disqualified for a\r\nshorter period, or not to order him to be disqualified.”\r\n15. The wording of the ‘special reason’ entry on the Magistrates’ Court record is curious\r\nand appears to support the Appellant’s current version of events in so far as it says that\r\nthere was “no intention to drive”, but not in so far as it states that “the distance driven was\r\nvery short indeed.” The Appellant says that the car did not move at all. Indeed, it would\r\nseem to be only in the most unusual of circumstances that a car could move any\r\nappreciable distance without there being any intention to drive (such as, perhaps, where a\r\nperson not intending to drive switches on the engine without appreciating that the car is in\r\ngear, something which I believe cannot happen in most modern cars, as it will be necessary\r\nto depress the clutch in order to start the engine).\r\n16. The FTT dealt with the significance of the Appellant’s version of events in paras. 26\r\nand 27 of its decision:\r\n“26. We have considered the Appellant’s oral and written evidence concerning the\r\ncircumstances which gave rise to his conviction for the offence of driving a motor vehicle with\r\nexcess alcohol, including the photographs which he submitted. We have noted that the entry\r\nfrom the Register of the South London Magistrates’ Court is ambiguous in that it records that\r\nthe magistrates found that there was no intention to drive but also that ‘the distance driven\r\nwas very short indeed’. The criminal offence with which the Appellant was charged and to\r\nwhich he entered a plea of guilty was that he drove a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol\r\nin excess of the prescribed limits. In these circumstances we cannot be totally convinced that\r\nthe vehicle remained stationary at all times as has been asserted by the Appellant.\r\n27. While acknowledging that the Magistrates accepted that special circumstances\r\nexisted so that an obligatory driving disqualification should not be imposed it remains the\r\ncase that the Appellant has been convicted, on his own admission, of the criminal offence of\r\ndriving a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol in excess of the prescribed limits. We cannot\r\nignore the gravity of that conviction.”\r\n17. The Appellant confirmed to me that he pleaded guilty. It appears from the Court\r\nrecord that that was at the first hearing of the matter on 28 April 2014, only some 15 days\r\nafter the offence occurred. The Appellant told me that he pleaded guilty on the advice of his\r\nsolicitor that he had no defence. It appears that the matter must then have been adjourned\r\nfor sentencing, possibly so that the issue of ‘special reasons’ could be tried, in so far as\r\nnecessary. The matter appears to have come back to the court on 6 August 2014. The\r\nAppellant told me that he was represented and that he had the owner of the restaurant and\r\nhis cousin present as witnesses, and that they gave evidence on his behalf.\r\nWould the Appellant’s contentions have amounted to a defence?\r\nAC v The Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors\r\n[2016] UKUT 0305 (AAC)\r\nGT/978/2016 4\r\n18. I have examined the case law in order to form at least a preliminary view on the\r\nquestion, whether, if the facts were as the Appellant now asserts, he would have had a\r\ndefence to the charge under s.5(1)(a) of the 1988 Act. In R v MacDonagh [1974] QB 448 it\r\nwas said that “the Act does not define the word “drive” and in its simplest meaning we think\r\nthat it refers to a person using the driver’s controls for the purpose of directing the\r\nmovement of the vehicle”, and that “although the word ‘drive’ must be given a wide\r\nmeaning, the courts must be alert to see that the net is not thrown so widely that it includes\r\nactivities which cannot be said to be driving a motor vehicle in any ordinary use of that word\r\nin the English language.” In Leach v DPP [1993] RTR 161 a case stated by justices asked\r\nthe question “whether a person sitting in the driving seat of a stationary motor vehicle, who\r\nswitches on the engine by turning the ignition key, sits erect in his seat and places his\r\nhands on the steering wheel could be a person driving a motor vehicle within the meaning\r\nof s.163 of the Road Traffic Act 1988”. The Divisional Court answered that question in the\r\nnegative. In that case the defendant switched on the engine with a view to driving off, which\r\nhe subsequently did, and the case was therefore a stronger one than the present for\r\narguing that the defendant was driving while the vehicle was still stationary. In Blayney v\r\nKnight (1974) 60 Cr. Appeal. R. 269 the Lord Chief Justice said in the Divisional Court:\r\n“The word ‘drive’ in this sort of context has been in contest and defined more than almost any\r\nother word in the English language, but it is I think of importance to remember that in one of\r\nthe most remembered cases, namely that of McDonagh (1974) 59 Cr. App. R. 55, a full Court\r\nof Appeal decided, amongst other things, that an activity could not be described as driving\r\ndespite the wide meaning of that word if the activity was something which could not be\r\naccepted as driving in any ordinary use of that word in the English language. So I ask myself\r\nat first in this case if anyone using the English language in the normal way was told or\r\nobserved that someone sitting in the driving seat of a car accidentally depressed the\r\naccelerator and thus caused the vehicle to move, would anybody giving the word ‘drive’ any\r\nsort of its common meaning in English have said that that man was driving, and it seems to\r\nme clearly he was not. I think this is quite a different case from almost any of the other cases\r\nwhere the person was consciously seeking some movement of the car in some way, and was\r\nthus driving. Here one has a man sitting in the driving seat, not intending to drive, and as far\r\nas I can see not intending to exercise any control over the vehicle, and accidentally his foot\r\ntouches the accelerator and off goes the car. I content myself by saying I do not think that in\r\nany ordinary use of the word ‘driving’ that conduct would be included.”\r\nIn R v. Attorney-General’s Reference (No 4 of 2000) [2001] 2 Cr. App. R. 22, on the other\r\nhand, it was held that a bus driver who drove about 100 yards, out of control and not\r\nintending to do so, because he pressed what he thought was the brake but was in fact the\r\naccelerator, was driving the bus.\r\n19. The upshot of the case law appears to be that if the facts were as the Appellant\r\nasserts, namely that he did no more than press the clutch and switch on the engine, in\r\norder to heat the car, with no intention of making the car move, either then or later, and that\r\nthe car did not move, then he did not drive the car, for the purposes of s. 5(1)(a), and so\r\nought not to have been advised that he had no option but to plead guilty. That may also be\r\nthe case even if the car did move a very small amount, without the Appellant intending that\r\nit should do so, although the position would then perhaps have been somewhat less clear.\r\n20. Section 5(1)(b) of the 1988 Act contains the alternative offence of being in charge of\r\na motor vehicle on a road or other public place, after consuming alcohol in excess of the\r\nprescribed limit. However, in relation to that offence it is provided in s.5(2) that it is a\r\ndefence to prove that the circumstances were such that there was no likelihood of the\r\naccused driving the vehicle while the prescribed limit was exceeded. If, therefore, the facts\r\nwere that the Appellant did not drive and had no intention to drive his car, he was not guilty\r\nof that offence either.\r\nAC v The Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors\r\n[2016] UKUT 0305 (AAC)\r\nGT/978/2016 5\r\nWas the Appellant entitled to seek to go behind the conviction?\r\n21. The FTT appears to have been content to decide the matter on the footing that (a)\r\nthe Appellant had been convicted on his own admission of the offence of drink driving and\r\n(b) the FTT “could not be totally convinced that the vehicle remained stationary at all times.”\r\nIn other words, the FTT appears to have considered that, the Appellant having been\r\nconvicted on his own admission, it was not necessary for the FTT to investigate the facts\r\nfurther, with a view to considering whether he would have had a defence if had not pleaded\r\nguilty. It was sufficient that he had pleaded guilty to the serious offence of drink driving. In\r\nhis extremely brief submission in this appeal the Registrar appears to adopt that approach,\r\nsubmitting as follows:\r\n“I do not consider that it is my jurisdiction to go behind a conviction, and therefore rely on the\r\nconviction itself as an indication of guilt.”\r\n22. The Registrar has, however, helpfully referred me to the decision of a FTT (ref\r\nD/2011/130), chaired by Judge Michael Brodrick (then principal judge of the First-tier\r\nTribunal (Transport)), in which consideration was given to the significance of a conviction in\r\ndriving instructor cases. The FTT noted in para. 21 of its decision that until that decision the\r\napproach of FTTs had apparently been that the FTT was “bound” by a conviction – i.e.\r\ncould not in deciding the appeal reconsider whether the offence had in fact been\r\ncommitted. The FTT in that case decided that it was open to a First-tier Tribunal to find that\r\nthe offence was not in fact committed. Its reasoning was as follows. That is the position\r\neven in civil courts to which the strict rules of evidence apply. In such courts the effect of\r\ns.11(1) and (2)(a) of the Civil Evidence Act 1968 is that a person is taken to have committed\r\nan offence of which he has been convicted (whether on a plea of guilty or otherwise) unless\r\nthe contrary is proved. The strict rules of evidence do not apply to FTTs, and before an FTT\r\nthe fact of a conviction, even on a plea of guilty, cannot be conclusive evidence that the\r\noffence was committed.\r\n23. In considering whether and to what extent it is permissible, in these cases, for an\r\napplicant to seek to go behind a conviction, I have become aware of the decision of Tucker\r\nJ. in Nottingham City Council v Farooq [1998] EWHC Admin 991. That was an appeal by\r\nway of case stated from a decision of magistrates, who were themselves deciding an\r\nappeal against a decision by the local authority that Mr Farooq was not a fit and proper\r\nperson to hold a private hire vehicle licence under the relevant statutory provision. One of\r\nthe questions posed for decision in the case stated was whether the magistrates had been\r\nentitled to review the merits of the applicant’s convictions for theft and deception. The\r\napplicant had pleaded guilty to those offences, and his stated reason for wishing to go\r\nbehind them was that he had pleaded guilty in an attempt to help a friend. Tucker J held\r\nthat it was not permissible for the justices to review the merits of the convictions. He said:\r\n“To that my answer is unhesitatingly ‘no’. The reason for that is that the convictions were\r\nrecorded on a plea of guilty, and if they had been contested would have had to be proved so\r\nas to make the Justices sure of their truth. In other words, the Justices would have had to be\r\nsatisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the respondent’s guilt, whereas in a civil case a very\r\ndifferent standard of proof applies, that is to say balance of probabilities.”\r\n24. Tucker J considered that his conclusion was supported by two authorities. The first\r\nwas the decision of Sedley J. in Adamson v Waveney District Council [1997] 2 All ER 898,\r\nwho said (at p.904):\r\n“Once some or all of the spent convictions are admitted in evidence, either before the local\r\nauthority committee or before justices, the applicant is then entitled naturally to be heard, not\r\nby way of suggesting that the convictions were incorrectly arrived at but in order to persuade\r\nAC v The Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors\r\n[2016] UKUT 0305 (AAC)\r\nGT/978/2016 6\r\nthe judicial authority that they are either, in truth, irrelevant or such, by reason of their age,\r\ncircumstances or lack of seriousness, that they should not jeopardise his application. All of\r\nthat is simple natural justice.”\r\n25. Secondly, Tucker J referred to a passage from the speech of Lord Diplock in Hunter\r\nv Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police and Others [1982] A.C. 529, a case relating\r\nto the circumstances in which it may be an abuse of process, and therefore impermissible,\r\nfor a claimant to seek to mount a collateral attack on a decision of a court of competent\r\njurisdiction (i.e. a criminal conviction) by initiating civil proceedings based on or involving a\r\ncontention that he did not commit the offence.\r\n26. I have also come across a decision of Sir Stephen Oliver QC, sitting as a Judge of\r\nthe Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery Chamber), in Sharma v FSA; ref FS/2010/0008.\r\nThat was an appeal against a decision of the FSA containing an order prohibiting Mr\r\nSharma from performing any functions in relation to any regulated activities, on the ground\r\nof his lack of fitness and propriety to conduct financial services business by reason of his\r\nconvictions of two financial services-related offences. The convictions followed a plea of\r\nguilty, and Mr Sharma’s contention in the appeal was that he was not guilty but had pleaded\r\nguilty on advice from his barrister that had he done otherwise he might have had to pay\r\nprosecution costs of some £30,000 (see para. 25 of the decision). The Upper Tribunal\r\nstruck out the appeals, stating:\r\n“49. By seeking to bring a collateral civil challenge to his criminal convictions via the\r\nTribunal, Mr Sharma is, I think, abusing the process. The leading case on the application of\r\nthe power to dismiss proceedings on this ground is Hunter v Chief Constable of the West\r\nMidlands Police [1982] AC 529. That and subsequent authority explain that the decision of a\r\ncourt of competent jurisdiction should not be relitigated. On that basis, Mr Sharma should not,\r\nin my view, be permitted to relitigate the matters behind his criminal convictions before this\r\nTribunal. Nor should he be permitted to go behind these convictions. The right course would\r\nhave been to have initiated a formal appeal in the criminal courts. I therefore conclude that\r\nMr Sharma’s reference constitutes an abuse of process and should be struck out for that\r\nreason (as a component of the wider strike out jurisdiction), as well as on the basis that he\r\nhas no prospect of success.”\r\n27. However, in so far as the basis of the decisions in Nottingham City Council v Farooq\r\nand Sharma v FSA was that there was a rule of public policy which absolutely prevented the\r\napplicants in those cases from going behind their convictions, the decisions were in my\r\njudgment wrong, for two reasons. First, the decisions were purportedly founded on the\r\ndecision of the House of Lords in the Hunter case. However, the rule of public policy\r\nreferred to by Lord Diplock appears to be one applying only in the situation where a\r\nclaimant seeks to mount a collateral attack on his previous conviction by mounting a civil\r\naction involving a contention that he did not commit the offence. It has been so held in, for\r\nexample, J v Oyston [1999] 1 WLR 694 and CXX v DXX [2012] EWHC 1535 (QBD). See\r\nalso Halsbury’s Laws, Vol 12A (Civil Procedure) at para. 1644, footnote 9. However, the\r\nreasoning behind these latter cases was in turn that it cannot automatically be an abuse to\r\ndo what s. 11 of the Civil Evidence Act 1968 permits a defendant to do – i.e. to seek to\r\nestablish that he did not commit the offence. But that reasoning itself does not apply directly\r\nto appeals before tribunals, which are not “civil proceedings” within the meaning of the 1968\r\nAct. It is unclear whether, for the purposes of the rule of public policy referred to in the\r\nHunter case, an appellant who seeks to overturn a decision that he is not a fit and proper\r\nperson to hold a licence or be on a register is to be considered as a person who is initiating\r\nproceedings mounting a collateral attack on a conviction, or rather as a person in a position\r\nanalogous to that of a defendant to a civil claim. I would have thought it was more the latter.\r\nAC v The Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors\r\n[2016] UKUT 0305 (AAC)\r\nGT/978/2016 7\r\n28. Secondly, and in any event, it was recognised in the Hunter case that the rule of\r\npublic policy is not absolute, and admits of an exception in, for example, the case of fresh\r\nevidence not available at the time of the conviction. Lord Diplock recognised that s.11 of the\r\n1968 Act can cover a wide variety of circumstances (and the same is plainly true in relation\r\nto the circumstances in which a person may seek to go behind a conviction in tribunal\r\nproceedings):\r\n“The section covers a wide variety of circumstances: the relevant conviction may be of\r\nsomeone who has not been made a defendant to the civil action and the actual defendant\r\nmay have had no opportunity of determining what evidence should be called on the occasion\r\nof the criminal trial; the conviction, particularly of a traffic offence, may have been\r\nentered on a plea of guilty accompanied by a written explanation in mitigation; fresh\r\nevidence, not called on the occasion of his conviction, may have been obtained by the\r\ndefendant’s insurers who were not responsible for the conduct of his defence in the criminal\r\ntrial. This wide variety of circumstances in which s.11 may be applicable includes some in\r\nwhich justice would require that no fetters should be imposed on the means by which a\r\ndefendant may rebut the statutory presumption that a person committed the offence of which\r\nhe has been convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction.” (My emphasis).\r\n29. However, it might be argued on behalf of the Registrar, and in support of the FTT’s\r\napproach in this case, as well as that taken in the Farooq and Sharma cases, that the\r\nposition in relation to what may be described as “fit and proper person” cases, is in effect\r\nsui generis, in that the mere fact that, as a matter of public record, the applicant stands\r\nconvicted of a serious and recent offence, at any rate one related to driving, should render\r\nthe applicant an unfit person. To enter or allow his name to remain on the Register, or to\r\ngrant him a licence, would bring the registration or licensing process into disrepute. Whether\r\nor not he was in fact guilty, the fact remains that he has been convicted, in this case on his\r\nown admission. One cannot (so the argument would run) have a person registered as an\r\napproved driving instructor when he stands convicted of a serious and recent offence.\r\n30. I would not accept that argument. In my judgment there is no rule, whether arising\r\nfrom the terms and purpose of the legislation relating to the register of driving instructors, or\r\nfrom general principles of public policy, which absolutely and in all circumstances prevents\r\nan applicant from seeking to go behind a conviction. If there are facts which justify an FTT\r\nin looking behind the conviction, and then in determining that the offence was not in fact\r\ncommitted, the mere fact of the conviction, even a recent and serious one, should not\r\nnecessarily mean that the applicant is not a fit and proper person to be on the Register.\r\n31. It is not necessary or appropriate for me, in this case, to attempt to formulate any\r\ngeneral principles as to when it is permissible for an applicant to seek to go behind a\r\nconviction. It seems to me that it will only be in exceptional cases that it will be appropriate\r\nfor a FTT to go behind a conviction, and in practice there is likely to be a heavy evidential\r\nburden on the applicant to prove that the conviction was not merited. Absent special reason\r\nan applicant should not, it seems to me, be entitled simply to relitigate, on a balance of\r\nprobabilities, a conviction reached on the basis of no reasonable doubt.\r\n32. It may also be relevant in the present case, albeit merely by way of background, that\r\nwhere a person pleads guilty in the Magistrates’ Court the only right of appeal is against\r\nsentence: see s.108(1)(a) of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980. However, it is possible to\r\npermit an accused to withdraw a guilty plea before sentence. He must apply to withdraw the\r\nplea as soon as practicable after becoming aware of the reasons for doing so. See,\r\ngenerally, Halsbury’s Laws, Vol 27 (Criminal Procedure), para. 187. In addition, a defendant\r\nmay appeal against conviction where the magistrates’ court proceeded on an equivocal plea\r\nof guilty. That covers cases, essentially, where a defendant indicates an intention to plead\r\nAC v The Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors\r\n[2016] UKUT 0305 (AAC)\r\nGT/978/2016 8\r\nguilty but then goes on to allege facts which, if proved, would provide a defence: see\r\nHalsbury’s Laws, Vol 28 (Criminal Procedure), para. 665.\r\nWas the FTT’s decision wrong in law?\r\n33. I am satisfied that the Appellant’s contentions in the present case (if established) do\r\nrender the case an exceptional one in which it would be permissible and appropriate to go\r\nbehind the conviction. The Appellant’s contention that the car did not move at all is to some\r\nextent supported by the wording of the “special reasons” – i.e. the Court’s own record -\r\nwhich as the FTT pointed out appears to be self-contradictory. The Court’s summary that\r\nthe car moved only a very short distance and that he had ‘no intention to drive’ is curious,\r\nand appears to cry out for further enquiry as to whether he was in fact driving his car.\r\n34. In circumstances where the FTT attached substantial significance to the fact of\r\nconviction, under a plea of guilty, in my judgment the FTT went wrong in law in not further\r\ninvestigating how the plea of guilty came about, and whether in fact the Appellant may have\r\nbeen wrongly advised that on his version of the facts he had no option but to plead guilty. If,\r\non the facts put to and accepted by the Magistrates’ Court at the time of sentencing, he did\r\nnot, as a matter of law, ‘drive’ the car and therefore was not in fact guilty of the offence, that\r\nis something which the FTT should in my judgment have taken into account. The effect of\r\nthe refusal to renew his registration has been to deprive the Appellant of his livelihood,\r\nwhich is of course a very serious matter. The Appellant told me, and Mrs Turland did not\r\nspecifically dispute, that the FTT did not question the Appellant as to how the plea of guilty\r\ncame about.\r\n35. The FTT would of course have been entitled to be sceptical about the Appellant’s\r\nversion of events. For one thing, as a matter of inherent probability it is unlikely that a\r\nsolicitor would have advised him to plead guilty if, on his version of the facts, he was not,\r\ngiven the potentially very serious consequences, for the Appellant, of a conviction. In\r\naddition, the version of events which the Applicant gave me conflicted to some extent with\r\nthat set out in his email of 8 October 2015. He told me that the reason why his cousin drove\r\nhim and his family to the restaurant in the Appellant’s own car was that he (the Appellant)\r\nwas giving his cousin (a learner driver) a driving lesson at the time, and that it was another\r\ncousin who was to drive them home. However, his email of 8 October said that he decided\r\nto start the car and put the heater on “while I wait for my cousin who drove us to the\r\nrestaurant to come out and take us home.”\r\n36. I do not of course overlook that there were other matters on which the Registrar and\r\nthe First-tier Tribunal relied as grounds for refusing registration, namely the previous\r\nconvictions in 2001 and the failure to inform the Registrar of the 2014 conviction. I record\r\nthat Mrs Turland told me that a failure to inform the Registrar about a conviction would not\r\nof itself (i.e. in the absence of other contributing factors) necessarily be considered a\r\nsufficiently serious ground for refusing registration.\r\nDirections to the new tribunal\r\n37. The new tribunal will therefore need to consider and make findings, in as much\r\ndetail as practicable, as to (i) the circumstances which led to the Appellant pleading guilty\r\nwhen (on his current version of events) it appears that he was in effect asserting that he\r\nwas not and (ii) whether he was in fact guilty of the offence of which he was convicted, or\r\nany related offence. It will need to take its findings into account when deciding whether to\r\nallow his appeal. The facts are entirely at large before the new tribunal.\r\n38. There are additional items of evidence which may be forthcoming and which may\r\neither confirm or undermine the Appellant’s version of events. The police may have made\r\nwitness statements for the purpose of the case, which may throw light on what they said\r\nAC v The Registrar of Approved Driving Instructors\r\n[2016] UKUT 0305 (AAC)\r\nGT/978/2016 9\r\nhappened in the car park. Those and other papers may be obtainable from either the police\r\nor the Crown Prosecution Service or the Appellant’s solicitor. The Appellant’s solicitor may\r\nhold other papers, and be able to confirm that he advised the Appellant to plead guilty, and\r\nwhy (although the Appellant would of course have to voluntarily waive legal professional\r\nprivilege in order to permit the solicitor to say what happened).\r\n39. The evidential burden of establishing that he was not guilty of the offence in practice\r\nlies on the Appellant. He must therefore carefully consider what further evidence, and in\r\nparticular documentation, he can obtain. But the FTT also of course has an investigatory\r\nfunction, and may consider it necessary, of its own motion, to direct third parties (and in\r\nparticular those mentioned in para. 31 above) to provide additional information, subject in\r\nthe case of the Appellant’s solicitors to questions of legal professional privilege. See,\r\ntherefore, my Directions in para. 1 above.\r\nCharles Turnbull\r\nJudge of the Upper Tribunal\r\n28 June 2016","tribunal_decision_categories":["transport-traffic-commissioner-and-doe-ni-appeals"],"tribunal_decision_decision_date":"2016-06-28","tribunal_decision_judges":["turnbull-c"],"tribunal_decision_sub_categories":["transport-traffic-commissioner-and-doe-ni-appeals-other"],"bulk_published":true},"max_cache_time":10,"temporary_update_type":false,"attachments":[{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/578f5f7ced915d3cfd000187/GT_0978_2016-00.pdf","title":"GT/978/2016","content_type":"application/pdf","updated_at":"2016-07-20T11:24:44Z","created_at":"2016-07-20T11:24:44Z","content_id":"2899fc11-b9cd-4978-bb3d-623602a817c7"}],"headers":[{"text":"Judicial Summary","level":2,"id":"judicial-summary"}],"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2016-12-01T16:20:24.981Z"}]},"routes":[{"path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions/ac-v-the-registrar-of-approved-driving-instructors-2016-ukut-305-aac","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"specialist-publisher","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"utaac_decision","schema_name":"specialist_document","first_published_at":"2016-12-01T16:20:25Z","base_path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions/ac-v-the-registrar-of-approved-driving-instructors-2016-ukut-305-aac","description":"Upper Tribunal Administrative Appeals Chamber decision by Judge Turnbull on 28 June 2016.\r\n","content_id":"3f8c2183-8e31-44a1-9f99-27ce459e4714","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"D18","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice","base_path":"/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice","content_id":"dcc907d6-433c-42df-9ffb-d9c68be5dc4d","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-07-18T17:26:49Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Ministry of Justice","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"ministry-of-justice","logo":{"formatted_title":"Ministry<br/>of Justice","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}},{"analytics_identifier":"EA73","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service","base_path":"/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service","content_id":"6f757605-ab8f-4b62-84e4-99f79cf085c2","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-02-21T14:12:20Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"HM Courts & Tribunals Service","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"ministry-of-justice","logo":{"formatted_title":"HM Courts &amp; <br/>Tribunals Service","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}},{"analytics_identifier":"PB1142","api_path":"/api/content/courts-tribunals/upper-tribunal-administrative-appeals-chamber","base_path":"/courts-tribunals/upper-tribunal-administrative-appeals-chamber","content_id":"4c2e325a-2d95-442b-856a-e7fb9f9e3cf8","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-06-18T16:08:53Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber)","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":null,"logo":{"formatted_title":"Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber)"}},"links":{}}],"finder":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions","base_path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions","content_id":"e9e7fcff-bb0d-4723-af25-9f78d730f6f8","description":"Find decisions on appeals to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber), including social security and child support appeals.","document_type":"finder","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-03-30T10:34:00Z","schema_name":"finder","title":"Administrative appeals tribunal decisions","withdrawn":false,"details":{"document_noun":"decision","filter":{"document_type":"utaac_decision"},"format_name":"Administrative appeals tribunal decision","show_summaries":true,"summary":"<p>Find decisions on appeals to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber), including social security and child support appeals.</p><p>This includes decisions made from January 2016 onwards.
