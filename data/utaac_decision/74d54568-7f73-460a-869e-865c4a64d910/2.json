The decision\r\nof the First-tier Tribunal stands.\r\nThis decision is given under section 11 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act\r\n2007.\r\nREASONS FOR DECISION\r\nThe real issue in this case\r\n1. The real issue in this case is whether or not the Appellant had been actively\r\nseeking employment for the 10-day period in question.\r\n2. A subsidiary issue in this case is what a Tribunal should do when the Secretary\r\nof State’s written submission on the Appellant’s appeal is, as the District Tribunal\r\nJudge who gave the Appellant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal put it,\r\n“lacking but not completely deficient and the decision is known but the grounds for it\r\nare less than crystal clear”.\r\nThe background to the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal\r\n3. The Appellant had been in receipt of jobseeker’s allowance since February 2009\r\n(for all bar five months). He had previously been “sanctioned” on “actively seeking\r\nemployment” grounds on several occasions. He may well, of course, have\r\nsuccessfully appealed against such “sanctions”, but the file does not reveal this.\r\n4. On 6 November 2014 a Jobcentre Plus decision-maker decided that the\r\nAppellant “was not actively seeking employment and cannot be treated as actively\r\nseeking employment in the weeks from 30/09/2014 to 13/10/2014 (both dates\r\nincluded)” (p.13). The Appellant wrote challenging that decision.\r\n5. On 14 April 2015 the DWP sent the Appellant a mandatory reconsideration\r\nnotice. This letter stated that the decision of 5 November 2014 (sic) had been looked\r\nat again but the decision had not been changed. This letter stated that the decision\r\nwas “to disallow your Jobseeker’s Allowance because you were not actively seeking\r\nemployment and cannot be treated as actively seeking employment during the period\r\nfrom 3/10/2014 to 13/10/2014 (both dates included)” (emphasis added; I return later\r\nto the discrepancy over dates). The Appellant lodged an appeal.\r\n6. The Secretary of State’s representative provided a response to the appeal which\r\nreferred to the decision of 6 November in terms of it being a supersession of an\r\nearlier decision to award jobseeker’s allowance (JSA). I return to the exact status of\r\nthe decision later. The response also re-asserted that the Appellant had not been\r\nactively seeking employment between 3/10/2014 and 13/10/2014. The Secretary of\r\nState’s response concluded with this statement:\r\n“18. Should the Tribunal decide that [the Appellant] was actively seeking\r\nemployment for the period from 3.10.2014 to 13.19.14, it is submitted that this\r\nwill not be sufficient to award JSA for the period. [The Appellant] is also required\r\nPC v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (JSA)\r\n[2016] UKUT 0277 (AAC)\r\nCJSA/722/2016 2\r\nto enter into a Jobseeker’s Agreement before he is entitled to JSA and he has\r\nnot agreed a jobseeker’s agreement for the period in question.”\r\nThe First-tier Tribunal’s decision\r\n7. The First-tier Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) confirmed the Secretary of State’s\r\ndecision and so dismissed the appeal. In the decision notice, issued on the day of the\r\nhearing, the Tribunal summarised its reasoning as follows:\r\n“[The Appellant] clearly has difficulties with the Job Centre, whom he blames\r\nsquarely for his situation, including the fact that withholding his benefits meant\r\nthat his calorie intake was reduced, thus making him physically disadvantaged\r\nin the job market. He had been banned from the Job Centre, and said he\r\nreceived no help or support, rather sanction upon sanction. Despite the\r\nTribunal’s patient attempts to obtain details and evidence from him, his only\r\nevidence to the point was that he had taken the steps that he thought best. He\r\nwas unable to give details, but continued to say that he understood he had not\r\nmade a valid claim in the first place. He is clearly of the view he is being\r\npunished by the DWP. [The Appellant] was unable to give the Tribunal any\r\ninformation to support his contention that he had carried out a sufficient job\r\nsearch. There was no alternative but to dismiss the appeal.”\r\n8. The Tribunal’s subsequent statement of reasons was in similar terms but with\r\nrather more by way of detail.\r\n9. It is also right to note that in both the decision notice and the statement of\r\nreasons the Tribunal commented on the poor quality of the Secretary of State’s\r\nwritten submission. In addition, the DWP had not sent a presenting officer to the\r\nTribunal hearing.\r\nThe grounds of appeal\r\n10. The Appellant then applied for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal,\r\nsetting out 10 grounds of appeal. The first two, by way of example, related to (i)\r\nparagraph 18 of the Secretary of State’s response (see paragraph 6 above); and (ii)\r\nthe poor state of that submission.\r\n11. The District Tribunal Judge gave the Appellant permission to appeal, noting that\r\nthe appeal raised the question as to what was a proportionate approach to a case\r\nwhere the Secretary of State’s response was “lacking but not completely deficient\r\nand the decision is known but the grounds for it are less than crystal clear”. He asked\r\nwhether the Tribunal should adjourn or proceed in such a case. Or rather was it all a\r\nquestion of fact and degree and could the Tribunal “on occasion safely proceed\r\nwithout committing an error of law if presented with an inadequate appeal response,\r\nprovided they explain why, and test the appellant’s evidence?”\r\n12. Mrs F. John, for the Secretary of State, resists the appeal to the Upper Tribunal;\r\nin summary, she argues the Tribunal’s treatment of the issues in dispute was\r\nsufficient and sustainable on the evidence it had before it.\r\nThe relevant law\r\n13. The core conditions for entitlement to JSA are contained in section 1 of the\r\nJobseekers Act 1995 (“the 1995 Act). They include the three “labour market\r\nconditions”, namely that the claimant (1) is available for employment; (2) is actively\r\nseeking employment; and (3) has entered into an extant jobseeker’s agreement (the\r\nPC v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (JSA)\r\n[2016] UKUT 0277 (AAC)\r\nCJSA/722/2016 3\r\n1995 Act, section 1(2)(a)-(c)). Unless treated as having met the condition in question,\r\nthe claimant must each of those three conditions.\r\n14. If any one of those three conditions is not met, then the claimant is simply not\r\nentitled to JSA, i.e. s/he does not qualify for JSA. Strictly, it is not the case that the\r\nclaimant is “sanctioned”. Technically, a sanction applies where an award of JSA\r\nwould otherwise be made (see e.g. sections 19 and 19A of the 1995 Act).\r\n15. Section 7(1) of the 1995 Act provides as follows:\r\n“For the purposes of this Act, a person is actively seeking employment in any\r\nweek if he takes in that week such steps as he can reasonably be expected to\r\nhave to take in order to have the best prospects of securing employment.”\r\n16. In addition, regulation 18(1) of the Jobseekers Regulations 1996 (SI 1996/207,\r\nas amended) declares that:\r\n“(1) For the purposes of section 7(1) (actively seeking employment) a person\r\nshall be expected to have to take more than two steps in any week unless taking\r\none or two steps is all that is reasonable for that person to do in that week.”\r\n17. The case law supports two clear propositions in relation to this legislation.\r\n18. The first is that it is for the claimant to show that he is actively seeking\r\nemployment, but that a tribunal cannot reject his evidence simply because it is\r\nuncorroborated (see the decision of Mrs Commissioner Brown in the Northern Ireland\r\ncases of C1/00-01 (JSA) and C2/00-01 (JSA)).\r\n19. The second is that the focus of the inquiry must be on what the claimant actually\r\ndid by way of job search, and its reasonableness in all the circumstances, and not on\r\nwhat he did not do – so whether or not each of the particular steps set out in the\r\njobseeker’s agreement was carried out is not determinative (see unreported\r\ndecisions CJSA/1814/2007 and CJSA/3416/2009).\r\nUpper Tribunal’s analysis\r\nThe central issue in the appeal\r\n20. Whatever the undoubted deficiencies in the Secretary of State’s written\r\nsubmission on the appeal, the fundamental issue for the Tribunal to decide was\r\nclear. The question was whether or not the Appellant had been actively seeking\r\nemployment for the period in dispute. The Appellant can have been under no illusion\r\nabout that. Both the mandatory reconsideration notice and the submission itself were\r\nat least clear about the question to be decided. As the submission concluded, “what\r\nthe tribunal has to decide is whether [the Appellant] was actively seeking work in the\r\nperiod 3.10.14 to 13.10.14 (both dates included) and, if not, whether he can be\r\ntreated as actively seeking work in either or both weeks during that period.”\r\n21. There is, moreover, no suggestion that the Appellant fell within any category of a\r\nperson who could be treated as actively seeking work. It followed that the Tribunal\r\nhad to determine whether he was actually actively seeking employment at the\r\nrelevant time.\r\n22. The short answer to this appeal is that this was ultimately a question of fact for\r\nthe Tribunal to assess. It is plain from the record of proceedings, the decision notice\r\nand the statement of reasons that the Judge was entirely unimpressed by the\r\nPC v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (JSA)\r\n[2016] UKUT 0277 (AAC)\r\nCJSA/722/2016 4\r\nAppellant’s account as to his job search activity. That was an assessment of fact\r\nwhich was sustainable on the evidence.\r\nThe inadequacies of the Secretary of State’s submission\r\n23. The Tribunal recognised three main failings in the Secretary of State’s\r\nsubmission. First, the decision itself was unclear. Second, the submission relied on a\r\njobseeker’s agreement which post-dated the decision under appeal. Third, the\r\ndecision-maker had announced that – whatever the outcome of the appeal – JSA\r\nwould not be paid (see paragraph 18 of the submission, referred to at paragraph 6\r\nabove). Did these weaknesses matter? I conclude they do not, for the following\r\nreasons.\r\n24. As to the first failing, the Tribunal did not specify in what particular respect the\r\ndecision lacked clarity. However, there are two obvious ways in which the decision\r\nwas less than clear.\r\n25. The first was that the commencement date for the decision was unclear given\r\nthe conflict between the start date for disentitlement on the original decision (given as\r\n30 September 2014) and the later date cited in the mandatory reconsideration notice\r\nand in the submission (stated as 3 October). The answer to that probably lay in a\r\nletter from the DWP that the Appellant produced at the hearing. The DWP letter\r\ndated 10 October 2014 was a separate decision letter stating that (i) the Appellant\r\nhad not satisfied the labour market conditions for the period from 8 July 2014 until 2\r\nOctober 2014; and (ii) he had not shown good cause for the delay in making the\r\nclaim over the same period. Presumably it therefore followed that the effective start\r\ndate for the subsequent decision on 6 November was actually 3 October 2014.\r\nHowever, the lack of clarity over the relevant start date had no material impact on the\r\nissue the Tribunal had to decide.\r\n26. The other way in which the decision lacked clarity concerned its precise status in\r\ndecision-making terms. The decision under appeal dated 6 November 2014 was\r\ndescribed in the Secretary of State’s response to the appeal as being a supersession\r\ndecision. Although I have not had detailed argument on the point, it appears in fact to\r\nbe a revision decision on any grounds, being taken within a month of the decision\r\ndated 10 October 2014 referred to in the previous paragraph. As such, it would have\r\nbeen on the Appellant to show he was actively seeking employment, rather than for\r\nthe Secretary of State to establish that he had not been doing so (and hence show a\r\nground for supersession). Given the strong terms of the Tribunal’s findings, I do not\r\nfind that this lack of clarity caused any unfairness or injustice.\r\n27. The second weakness in the Secretary of State’s submission was that it relied\r\non a jobseeker’s agreement which, on the face of it, post-dated the decision under\r\nappeal. The submission referred to a jobseeker’s agreement (“My claimant\r\ncommitment”) on file dated 19 November 2014, i.e. about a fortnight after the\r\ndecision under appeal. The Appellant had added under his signature the phrase\r\n“SIGNED UNDER DURESS”. The Appellant brought to the hearing copies of two\r\nearlier jobseeker’s agreements dated 15 November 2013 and 17 March 2014. The\r\nTribunal referred to the latter agreement in its statement of reasons. Mrs John, who\r\nnow acts for the Secretary of State, argues in her submission to the Upper Tribunal\r\nthat the agreement dated 19 November 2014 was in fact the relevant agreement.\r\nShe points out that the fact that the Appellant had been banned from attending at his\r\nJob Centre had probably resulted in a delay in its completion, but that there was\r\npower under statute to backdate such an agreement (see section 9(11) of the 1995\r\nAct). However, whether or not the Tribunal directed its mind to the correct\r\nPC v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (JSA)\r\n[2016] UKUT 0277 (AAC)\r\nCJSA/722/2016 5\r\nagreement, the differences between the terms of the two agreements are relatively\r\nminor. There is no suggestion that the appeal failed because of an omission on the\r\npart of the Appellant to carry out a step which was included in the non-operative\r\nagreement. Rather, the Tribunal (correctly) addressed the issue of reasonableness in\r\nthe round, as required by case law, and found the appeal failed on that basis.\r\n28. The third weakness in the submission was the rider at the end (i.e. in paragraph\r\n18 of the submission) to the effect that JSA would not be paid in any event. This\r\nclearly exercised the Appellant, who wrote to the Tribunal before the hearing, asking\r\nwhat the point of the appeal was in those circumstances (p.20). In fact the statement\r\nat paragraph 18 of the submission was a cack-handed way of the decision-maker\r\nmaking the point that the three labour market conditions are independent and\r\ncumulative. Entitlement depends on each being satisfied in turn. In the event there\r\nwas arguably no problem with the jobseeker’s agreement, given the power to have it\r\nbackdated. There is also a procedure for challenging the terms of a jobseeker’s\r\nagreement (see section 9(6) of the 1995 Act). Be that as it may, as Mrs John argues,\r\nwhilst paragraph 18 of the submission may have been unhelpful and indeed\r\nconfusing, it did not divert the Tribunal from its focus on the substance of the appeal,\r\nnamely whether the Appellant had been actively seeking employment in the fortnight\r\nin question.\r\n29. So the Secretary of State’s submission was rightly found wanting in several\r\nrespects. However, the fundamental purpose of an appeal to the First-tier Tribunal in\r\nthe Social Entitlement Chamber is not to rank the Secretary of State’s submission by\r\nway of a pass or fail mark. The purpose of the appeal is to determine the appellant’s\r\nentitlement to benefit. A clear submission may well aid that process. A weak\r\nsubmission may well hinder it. However, whatever the weaknesses of this particular\r\nsubmission, it is obvious that the Tribunal kept its focus firmly on the issue to be\r\ndetermined. There was no breach of natural justice or other procedural unfairness.\r\nThe Appellant knew the case he had to answer and the Tribunal asked appropriate\r\nquestions in the exercise of its inquisitorial jurisdiction. So where does this leave the\r\nAppellant’s ten grounds of appeal?\r\nThe Appellant’s grounds of appeal\r\n30. The first ground is a complaint about paragraph 18 of the Secretary of State’s\r\nsubmission. That grounds fails – see the explanation at paragraph 28 above.\r\n31. The second ground was the poor state of the Secretary of State’s submission\r\noverall. That ground is also dismissed, for the reasons at paragraphs 23-29 above.\r\n32. The third ground was the alleged prejudice to the Appellant caused by the\r\nreference to other “sanctions”. There is nothing in this – the Tribunal’s reasons make\r\nit clear that it properly considered the Appellant’s steps in the period under review.\r\n33. The fourth ground was the decision-maker’s failure to produce evidence of six\r\njob vacancies which were said to be advertised. This was undoubtedly another\r\nweakness in the submission. This ground might have had more purchase if the\r\nAppellant was actually being sanctioned for failing to apply for a specific notified\r\nvacancy (under section 19(2)(c) of the 1995 Act). However, it ignores the fact that the\r\nfocus was rather on what steps the Appellant had taken in the relevant period, not\r\nwhat steps he had not taken, and he failed to satisfy the Tribunal on that count.\r\nPC v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (JSA)\r\n[2016] UKUT 0277 (AAC)\r\nCJSA/722/2016 6\r\n34. The fifth ground was that the Tribunal was said to have ignored the Appellant’s\r\ncase that he had taken reasonable steps. However, this is an attempt to re-argue a\r\nquestion of fact and discloses no legal error.\r\n35. The sixth ground was a complaint that the Tribunal was rushed. However, the\r\nrecord of proceedings showed the Appellant was given sufficient opportunity to make\r\nout his case.\r\n36. The seventh ground relates to the post-dated jobseeker’s agreement; this\r\nground goes nowhere for the reason explained at paragraph 27 above.\r\n37. The eighth ground relies on Commissioner’s decision CJSA/1814/2007.\r\nHowever, the Tribunal’s approach is consistent with the principles set out in that\r\ndecision.\r\n38. The ninth ground is really a restatement of the second ground of appeal. The\r\nAppellant also argues that he should somehow have been given the benefit of the\r\ndoubt. However, that is inconsistent with the principles underpinning entitlement to\r\nbenefit.\r\n39. The tenth ground refers to the difficulties the Appellant had with the Job Centre.\r\nThe Tribunal was clearly alive to those problems, but still found the Appellant had not\r\nshown he was actively seeking employment. Again, this was ultimately a question of\r\nfact, not law.\r\nConclusion\r\n40. For all these reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not involve any\r\nmaterial error of law. I must therefore dismiss the appeal (Tribunals, Courts and\r\nEnforcement Act 2007, section 11).\r\nSigned on the original Nicholas Wikeley\r\non 13 June 2016 Judge of the Upper Tribunal","tribunal_decision_categories":["jobseekers-allowance","tribunal-procedure-and-practice"],"tribunal_decision_decision_date":"2016-06-13","tribunal_decision_judges":["wikeley-n"],"tribunal_decision_sub_categories":["jobseekers-allowance-availability-for-employment","tribunal-procedure-and-practice-fair-hearing"],"bulk_published":true},"max_cache_time":10,"temporary_update_type":false,"attachments":[{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/578f31a3e5274a0da900012c/CJSA_0722_2016-00.pdf","title":"CJSA/722/2016","content_type":"application/pdf","updated_at":"2016-07-20T08:09:07Z","created_at":"2016-07-20T08:09:07Z","content_id":"c6060e07-5b4c-4338-9e9d-4092ad9e1817"}],"headers":[{"text":"Judicial Summary","level":2,"id":"judicial-summary"}],"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2016-12-01T16:20:22.609Z"}]},"routes":[{"path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions/pc-v-secretary-of-state-for-work-and-pensions-jsa-2016-ukut-277-aac","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"specialist-publisher","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"utaac_decision","schema_name":"specialist_document","first_published_at":"2016-12-01T16:20:22Z","base_path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions/pc-v-secretary-of-state-for-work-and-pensions-jsa-2016-ukut-277-aac","description":"Upper Tribunal Administrative Appeals Chamber decision by Judge Wikeley on 13 June 2016.","content_id":"74d54568-7f73-460a-869e-865c4a64d910","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"D18","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice","base_path":"/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice","content_id":"dcc907d6-433c-42df-9ffb-d9c68be5dc4d","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-07-18T17:26:49Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Ministry of Justice","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"ministry-of-justice","logo":{"formatted_title":"Ministry<br/>of Justice","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}},{"analytics_identifier":"EA73","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service","base_path":"/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service","content_id":"6f757605-ab8f-4b62-84e4-99f79cf085c2","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-02-21T14:12:20Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"HM Courts & Tribunals Service","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"ministry-of-justice","logo":{"formatted_title":"HM Courts &amp; <br/>Tribunals Service","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}},{"analytics_identifier":"PB1142","api_path":"/api/content/courts-tribunals/upper-tribunal-administrative-appeals-chamber","base_path":"/courts-tribunals/upper-tribunal-administrative-appeals-chamber","content_id":"4c2e325a-2d95-442b-856a-e7fb9f9e3cf8","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-06-18T16:08:53Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber)","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":null,"logo":{"formatted_title":"Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber)"}},"links":{}}],"finder":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions","base_path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions","content_id":"e9e7fcff-bb0d-4723-af25-9f78d730f6f8","description":"Find decisions on appeals to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber), including social security and child support appeals.","document_type":"finder","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-03-30T10:34:00Z","schema_name":"finder","title":"Administrative appeals tribunal decisions","withdrawn":false,"details":{"document_noun":"decision","filter":{"document_type":"utaac_decision"},"format_name":"Administrative appeals tribunal decision","show_summaries":true,"summary":"<p>Find decisions on appeals to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber), including social security and child support appeals.</p><p>This includes decisions made from January 2016 onwards.
