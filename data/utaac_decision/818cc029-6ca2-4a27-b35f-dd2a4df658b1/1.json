The appellant, who was born on 26 January 1973 and who suffers from health\r\nproblems which include back pain, asthma, anxiety, depression, tennis elbow and pain in his left\r\nleg and left foot had been receiving incapacity benefit since 31 January 1996. Pursuant to what\r\nis referred to as “the conversion phase” he was assessed for entitlement to its replacement\r\nbenefit, employment and support allowance. As a part of that assessment he completed a\r\nstandard form known as form ESA50 and then attended a medical examination which was\r\nconducted by a healthcare professional. That examination took place on 31 December 2014.\r\nThereafter, on 2 February 2015, seemingly in reliance upon the conclusions of the healthcare\r\nprofessional, the respondent decided that the appellant was not entitled to employment and\r\nsupport allowance from that date. In fact, it was decided that he did not score any points at all\r\nunder the various activities and descriptors contained within Schedule 2 to the Employment\r\nand Support Allowance Regulations 2008 and that he did not meet the requirements of\r\nregulation 29 of those Regulations. He sought a mandatory reconsideration which did not lead\r\nto any alternation in the decision and, thereafter, he appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (F-tT).\r\n2. The F-tT held an oral hearing which took place on 3 June 2015. The appellant\r\nattended and gave oral evidence. He was represented, and indeed continues to be represented,\r\nby Mr W Hatton of the Exeter Citizens Advice Bureau. The respondent was not represented.\r\nThe F-tT, after listening to what the appellant and Mr Hatton had to say, dismissed the appeal\r\nAB v The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (ESA)\r\n[2016] UKUT 0096 (AAC)\r\nCE/3255/2015 2\r\nconcluding, as had the respondent, that no points were scored in relation to any of the\r\nactivities and descriptors within Schedule 2 and that the requirements of regulation 29 were\r\nnot satisfied. It issued its decision notice on the day of the hearing. Thereafter, and upon\r\nrequest, it produced its statement of reasons for decision (“statement of reasons”) in which it\r\nset out its reasoning in some considerable detail.\r\n3. The appellant, aided by Mr Hatton, applied for permission to appeal to the\r\nUpper Tribunal. The grounds took various points regarding the way in which the F-tT had\r\napproached various items of evidence and the way in which it had explained its decision though\r\nI did not think, for the most part, that the bulk of those points went beyond an attempt to reargue\r\nmatters of fact properly resolved by the F-tT. However, I did grant permission to appeal\r\nbecause I thought it arguable that the F-tT had erred in concluding descriptor 15(c) in\r\nSchedule 2 was not satisfied simply because the appellant was able to get to an unfamiliar place\r\nby using a taxi. I raised the question of whether or not, in such circumstances, such a journey\r\ncould not be described as one made “without being accompanied by another person” given the\r\npresence of a taxi driver. I noted that, if it had been found that the appellant satisfied that\r\ndescriptor, it would still only entitle him to 6 points but I considered any such error, if made,\r\nmight be material on the basis that an inability to undertake a journey to a specified place with\r\nwhich the appellant was unfamiliar might have some relevance to the regulation 29\r\nconsideration.\r\n4. In this context, the relevant activity and descriptor are as follows:\r\nActivity\r\n15. Getting about.\r\nDescriptors\r\n15. (a) …\r\n(b) …\r\n(c) Is unable to get to a\r\nspecified place with which\r\nthe claimant is unfamiliar\r\nwithout being accompanied\r\nby another person.”\r\n5. As to Activity 15 the F-tT, in its statement of reasons, had said this:\r\n“15. [The appellant] said that he has difficulties in going to unfamiliar places as he does not\r\nhave a good sense of direction (page 146). He said his difficulties in using taxis would be\r\nbecause he does not like being a passenger in strange cars (page 146). He did not say he would\r\nhave any other difficulties. He was not able to identify when going out on his own became a\r\nproblem other than it has been a problem for a few years (page 149). He has recently started\r\ntherapy for depression and anxiety. A letter from the Depression and Anxiety Service stated\r\nthat he disclosed symptoms of social anxiety and agoraphobia. [The appellant] had started\r\nseeing that service shortly before the date of the decision although he has had depression for\r\nmany years. However [the appellant’s] evidence was inconsistent. On the claim form he said\r\nhe cannot go to familiar places (page 48) whereas his evidence to the Tribunal was that he\r\ncould go to the shop and the GP on his own (page 145). The GP does not mention agoraphobia.\r\nWe preferred [the appellant’s] evidence to the Tribunal because we found it more likely to be\r\ncredible as it was coming directly from him whereas the claim form had been completed by his\r\nAB v The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (ESA)\r\n[2016] UKUT 0096 (AAC)\r\nCE/3255/2015 3\r\npartner on his behalf. We found on the balance of probability that he would be able to use a\r\ntaxi for example to get to an unfamiliar place and that therefore he would be able to get to a\r\nspecified place with which he was unfamiliar without being accompanied by another person.”\r\n6. Having granted permission I issued directions requiring further submissions from the\r\nperties. Ms S Suttenstall, who now acts for the Secretary of State in connection with this\r\nappeal to the Upper Tribunal, lodged a submission of 15 January 2016 in which she indicated\r\nthat the appeal was not supported. She agreed with my preliminary view, expressed in my\r\ngrant, that the bulk of the points made in the grounds did not demonstrate any error of law on\r\nthe part of the F-tT. As to the specific basis on which I granted permission (though the grant\r\nwas not limited) she contended that where a claimant is taken to a destination in a taxi the taxi\r\ndriver, who is simply providing a paid for transport service, cannot be said to accompany that\r\nclaimant. She compared the situation to that of a claimant undertaking a journey by bus and\r\nargued that, on such a journey, it could not be realistically contended that such a claimant\r\nwould be “accompanied” by the bus driver. She made reference to the dictionary definition of\r\nthe word “accompanied” and the points she made as to that are encapsulated in paragraph 12\r\nwhere she said this:\r\n“ 12. I also note the ordinary dictionary definition of ‘accompanied’ – ‘to keep company\r\nwith, to convoy, escort or attend’. Breaking this definition down, I submit that a taxi driver\r\ndoes not fit the dictionary definition; ‘company’ – the fact or condition of being with another or\r\nothers especially in a way that provides friendship and enjoyment, ‘convoy’ – a group of ships\r\nor vehicles travelling together, typically accompanied by armed troops, war ships or other\r\nvehicles for protection,‘escort’ – a person, vehicle or group accompanying another for\r\nprotection or as mark of rank, ‘attend’ – to deal with (synonyms cope , manage, organise). In\r\nview of this, I submit the dictionary definition suggests something more than being driven from\r\none place to another by a stranger. It suggests some form of protection, managing and/or\r\nfriendship which is over and beyond what a taxi driver provides.”\r\n7. The appellant, through Mr Hatton, indicated that all the original grounds of appeal\r\nwere still relied upon. He argued that there was a significant difference between travelling by\r\nbus and travelling by taxi, not least because a taxi is usually provided for the exclusive use of a\r\nhirer and because a taxi normally conveys a passenger “door-to-door”. He also drew attention\r\nto the appellant’s evidence to the F-tT that he would not wish to be conveyed in a taxi, in any\r\nevent, unless he knew the taxi driver.\r\n8. It does seem to me in looking at, in particular, the closing sentence of paragraph 15 of\r\nits statement of reasons as set out above, that the F-tT was deciding that the appellant could\r\nget to an unfamiliar place by taxi and that an ability to do that meant he could not show an\r\ninability to get to a specified place with which he is unfamiliar without being accompanied by\r\nanother person. I appreciate that the use of the term “for example” might be taken to suggest\r\nthat the F-tT may have thought there were other ways he could get to an unfamiliar place\r\nunaccompanied but none of these other ways, if it did think there were any, were referred to or\r\nexplained. Accordingly, it does seem to me, that if it was not permitted to conclude as a\r\nmatter of law that a journey in a taxi was an unaccompanied journey or if it failed to adequately\r\nexplain why it thought such a journey should be regarded as an unaccompanied one, it would\r\nerr in law.\r\n9. Ms Suttenstall’s submission is to the effect that the nature of the relationship between a\r\ntaxi driver and a passenger and the function of a taxi driver who is driving a passenger is such\r\nAB v The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (ESA)\r\n[2016] UKUT 0096 (AAC)\r\nCE/3255/2015 4\r\nas to preclude, having regard to a dictionary definition, that journey being, from the\r\npassenger’s perspective, an accompanied one. I see the point she makes but I do not think, in\r\ncontext, the approach of taking a dictionary definition is helpful.\r\n10. The basic question posed by descriptor 15(c) is whether a claimant is unable, in\r\nconsequence of difficulties with mental, cognitive and intellectual function (because this is a\r\nmental health descriptor), to get to an unfamiliar place without being accompanied by another\r\nperson. In this context it is worth considering why a person might want to or might need to\r\nundertake a journey by taxi as opposed to by another means such as walking.\r\n11. Such a person might be prone, because of difficulties with cognitive or intellectual\r\nfunction, to getting lost. Such a person might be very nervous of crowds or even small groups\r\nof people such that he/she would not want to be in a position where such crowds or groups\r\nmight be encountered. Such a person might have a fear of open spaces. At the opposite end\r\nof the spectrum a person might simply prefer to ride in a taxi due to indolence.\r\n12. I think the answer lies, then, in looking at the situation from the perspective of the\r\nrelevant claimant taking into account the particular mental health problems which are said to\r\ncreate the difficulties in getting about. If a claimant suffers from anxiety such that he would\r\nnot be able to undertake the journey on foot but would be sufficiently reassured by the mere\r\npresence of someone else in a vehicle with him, then such a taxi journey would be\r\n“accompanied” because, even if the claimant and the taxi driver did not interact by way of\r\ndiscourse, the presence of the taxi driver would be a significant contributory factor to that\r\nclaimant’s ability to make that journey. If a claimant would otherwise get lost, the taxi journey\r\nis an accompanied one because the taxi driver is acting as the claimant’s navigator and, again,\r\nmaking a significant contribution to the ability of the claimant to make the journey. If a\r\nclaimant cannot face crowds in open spaces then the taxi driver is ensuring he is not put into a\r\nsituation where he has to do so and, therefore, once again, is playing a significant role in the\r\ncompletion of the journey. Put another way, if a claimant can only undertake a journey to an\r\nunfamiliar place by taxi because of a requirement of undertaking the journey in the presence of\r\nanother person or because the assistance of that other person is required, then that journey is,\r\nfor the purposes of the relevant descriptor, an accompanied one.\r\n13. That was not the approach which was taken by this F-tT. It appears to have simply\r\nassumed that a journey in a taxi would be an unaccompanied journey without enquiring into\r\nwhether the presence of the taxi driver was essential or important to the appellant’s ability to\r\nmake a journey to a specified place with which he was unfamiliar. It did, thereby, err in law.\r\n14. The error, though, as I say, had it not been made, would not have been material insofar\r\nas points are concerned because it would not have led to the appellant, even if there had been\r\nan award under 15(c), reaching the 15 point threshold. However, it is possible that if the F-tT\r\nhad decided the appellant was not able to get to unfamiliar places unaccompanied as a result of\r\nmental health difficulties (the depression and anxiety) this would have caused it to consider\r\nwhether such mental health difficulties had a bearing upon the regulation 29(2)(b) test. As it\r\nwas, the F-tT did not make any specific reference to mental health difficulties other than what\r\nappears to be mild obsessive compulsive disorder when explaining its regulation 29 reasoning.\r\nFurther, as was pointed out in EJ v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (ESA) [2014]\r\nUKUT 511 (AAC) when a person does satisfy descriptor 15(c) in Schedule 2 then it may be\r\nnecessary to consider whether embarking upon a hypothetical journey to a hypothetical\r\nAB v The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (ESA)\r\n[2016] UKUT 96 (AAC)\r\nCE/3255/2015 5\r\nworkplace might lead to the risk envisaged in regulation 29(2)(b) arising until such a journey\r\nbecomes familiar. It was also said that third party assistance by way of accompaniment might\r\nbe a possible means of avoiding any such risk but that evidence regarding the availability or\r\notherwise of such third party assistance will be required. This was not, however, something\r\nwhich the F-tT looked into at all. So, I conclude that the error the F-tT did make was a\r\nmaterial one and that, in consequence, its decision must be set aside.\r\n15. It is not, then, necessary for me to say anything further about the other grounds of\r\nappeal which were advanced on the appellant’s behalf other than what I have already said.\r\nAny further errors of law the F-tT may have made will be subsumed by the fresh hearing which\r\nwill now follow. There will be a fresh hearing because there are further facts to be found, in\r\nconsequence of my having set the decision aside, and that is a task best suited to the F-tT as an\r\nexpert fact-finding body and as a body which will have, available to it, both legal and medical\r\nexpertise.\r\n16. This appeal to the Upper Tribunal, therefore, is allowed on the basis and to the extent\r\nset out above.\r\n(Signed on the original)\r\nM R Hemingway\r\nJudge of the Upper Tribunal\r\nDated: 18 February 2016","tribunal_decision_categories":["employment-and-support-allowance"],"tribunal_decision_decision_date":"2016-02-18","tribunal_decision_judges":["hemingway-m"],"tribunal_decision_sub_categories":["employment-and-support-allowance-post-28-3-11-wca-activity-15-getting-about"],"bulk_published":true},"max_cache_time":10,"temporary_update_type":false,"attachments":[{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5783840540f0b652dd000127/CE_3255_2015.pdf","title":"CE 3255 2015","content_type":"application/pdf","updated_at":"2016-07-11T11:33:25Z","created_at":"2016-07-11T11:33:25Z","content_id":"0a79aad8-7c75-4e31-8a21-1fae381fe3ae"}],"headers":[{"text":"Judicial Summary","level":2,"id":"judicial-summary"}],"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2016-12-01T16:20:12.753Z"}]},"routes":[{"path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions/ab-v-the-secretary-of-state-for-work-and-pensions-esa-2016-ukut-96-aac","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"specialist-publisher","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"utaac_decision","schema_name":"specialist_document","first_published_at":"2016-12-01T16:20:13Z","base_path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions/ab-v-the-secretary-of-state-for-work-and-pensions-esa-2016-ukut-96-aac","description":"Upper Tribunal Administrative Appeals Chamber decision by Judge Hemingway on 18 February 2016.","content_id":"818cc029-6ca2-4a27-b35f-dd2a4df658b1","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"D18","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice","base_path":"/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice","content_id":"dcc907d6-433c-42df-9ffb-d9c68be5dc4d","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-07-18T17:26:49Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Ministry of Justice","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"ministry-of-justice","logo":{"formatted_title":"Ministry<br/>of Justice","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}},{"analytics_identifier":"EA73","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service","base_path":"/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service","content_id":"6f757605-ab8f-4b62-84e4-99f79cf085c2","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-02-21T14:12:20Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"HM Courts & Tribunals Service","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"ministry-of-justice","logo":{"formatted_title":"HM Courts &amp; <br/>Tribunals Service","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}},{"analytics_identifier":"PB1142","api_path":"/api/content/courts-tribunals/upper-tribunal-administrative-appeals-chamber","base_path":"/courts-tribunals/upper-tribunal-administrative-appeals-chamber","content_id":"4c2e325a-2d95-442b-856a-e7fb9f9e3cf8","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-06-18T16:08:53Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber)","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":null,"logo":{"formatted_title":"Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber)"}},"links":{}}],"finder":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions","base_path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions","content_id":"e9e7fcff-bb0d-4723-af25-9f78d730f6f8","description":"Find decisions on appeals to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber), including social security and child support appeals.","document_type":"finder","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-03-30T10:34:00Z","schema_name":"finder","title":"Administrative appeals tribunal decisions","withdrawn":false,"details":{"document_noun":"decision","filter":{"document_type":"utaac_decision"},"format_name":"Administrative appeals tribunal decision","show_summaries":true,"summary":"<p>Find decisions on appeals to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber), including social security and child support appeals.</p><p>This includes decisions made from January 2016 onwards.
