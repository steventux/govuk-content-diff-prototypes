This is an appeal from the decision of the Traffic Commissioner for the\r\nWest Midlands (“TC”) made on 4 August 2016 when he refused the\r\nAppellant’s application (“Ms Aziz”) for a restricted PSV operator’s\r\nlicence.\r\nBackground\r\n2. The factual background to the appeal appears from the documents and\r\nthe TC’s oral decision. The family of Ms Aziz is involved in the\r\noperation of limousines. A2Z Limos 4 U Limited (“the company”) is a\r\ncompany which is operated by the father of Ms Aziz. It presently has\r\ntwo limousines in its possession which require an operator’s licence to\r\nbe operated lawfully (having nine to sixteen seats). The company does\r\nnot hold such a licence. The vehicles are currently leased out to other\r\noperators with PSV licences. The company operates from 57 Milk\r\nStreet, Digbeth Birmingham. The premises are owned by Ms Aziz’\r\nbrother, Bilal, who was also a director of the company. It is unclear\r\nwhether he continues to be a director. Bilal and her other brother Iqbal,\r\nalso operate vintage cars and Lincoln limousines from the same\r\npremises. Those vehicles are licensed by the local authority, being\r\nvehicles which do not fall within the PSV regime, having eight seats or\r\nfewer.\r\n3. Either at the end of 2009 or the beginning of 2010 (it is unclear from the\r\npapers), a limousine being operated by the company was found to be\r\noperating without an operator’s licence. It was carrying ten teenagers\r\non a journey which fell within the EU regulations. The vehicle did not\r\nhave a Certificate of Initial Fitness (“COIF”), it was uninsured, it did not\r\nhave a MOT certificate and was not fitted with a tachograph. Iqbal was\r\nthe driver. It was asserted by Iqbal and Bilal that the vehicle was\r\noperating under a dry hiring agreement (a device designed to\r\ncircumvent the need for an operator’s licence) and in support of that\r\nassertion, paperwork was produced with a forged signature appended\r\nto it. It was subsequently accepted by both brothers that the signature\r\nwas forged.\r\n4. On 27 July 2010, the company was convicted of the following offences:\r\na) Using a vehicle as a PSV when there was no tachograph recording\r\nequipment fitted;\r\n3\r\nb) Using a vehicle as a PSV when the driver failed to keep a record of\r\nthe journey;\r\nc) Using a vehicle as a PSV when the company did not hold a valid\r\noperator’s licence;\r\nd) Using a PSV when the vehicle had not been issued with a\r\nCertificate of Initial Fitness;\r\ne) Using a vehicle as a PSV without insurance.\r\nThe company was fined a total of £10,200 with £600 costs.\r\n5. On the same day, Iqbal was convicted of the following offences:\r\na) Driving a vehicle as a PSV where there was no tachograph\r\nrecording equipment fitted;\r\nb) Driving a vehicle as a PSV and failing to keep a record;\r\nc) Aiding and abetting the use of a PSV when there was no operator’s\r\nlicence.\r\nIqbal was fined £250 with £300 costs.\r\n6. On the same day, Bilal was convicted of conspiring to pervert the\r\ncourse of justice by using a false instrument and was sentenced to 20\r\nweeks imprisonment, suspended for two years with 200 hours of\r\ncommunity service.\r\n7. In the latter part of 2010, the company applied for a restricted\r\noperator’s licence authorising two limousines operating from 57 Milk\r\nStreet. A public inquiry was scheduled for 20 December 2010.\r\nHowever, on 17 December 2010, Bilal, on behalf of the company\r\nformally withdrew the application. In about the beginning of 2011, Iqbal\r\napplied for a restricted operator’s licence authorising one limousine,\r\noperating from 57 Milk Street. When making the application, Iqbal\r\nmade a false declaration that he did not have any convictions. A public\r\ninquiry took place on 11 July 2011 which culminated in a written\r\ndecision in which the TC found that:\r\n“The applicant is unreliable and untrustworthy. I carry very little weight\r\nas to what he said in evidence, as he says what suits his purpose at\r\nthe time. He was consistently untruthful with the Traffic Examiner\r\nTracey Love. I have concerns that if Iqbal Aziz was granted any\r\noperator’s licence that he would not comply with the rules that apply.\r\nThe explanation given to me relating to non-disclosure of convictions is\r\nnot credible and I do not accept the explanation .. Iqbal Aziz sought to\r\nmislead me.\r\n4\r\nI do not accept that applicant’s suggestion that his reference to dry\r\nhiring was a spur of the moment response to being stopped; it is not\r\nconsistent with the evidence on file.\r\nI am aware that there are many good operators of limousines who\r\nspend a lot of money making their vehicles compliant and also\r\nadhering to the strict rules in relation to drivers’ hours and records.\r\nI am also conscious that there are rogue operators who pay little or no\r\nheed to the law and operate limousines with both a significant\r\ncompetitive advantage and at a real risk to road users and passengers.\r\nThe vehicles without COIFs are not merely illegal; they are inherently\r\ndangerous. The cost of making an unsafe limousine safe and\r\ncompliant with a COIF is often a figure approaching £20,000.\r\nIqbal Aziz has no place in the operator licensing system. I have been\r\nasked to give him a second chance, but I do not see a place .. for\r\ndishonest rogues who persistently lie to VOSA staff and attempt to mislead\r\nme. ... Keeping him out of the passenger transport industry will\r\nassist both the travelling public and compliant operators. ..”\r\n8. By an application received on 19 January 2016, Ms Aziz applied for a\r\nrestricted operator’s licence authorising one limousine operating from\r\n57 Milk Street. The application and subsequent responses to further\r\nquestions resulted in the TC determining that a public inquiry should be\r\nheld. The call up letter raised in particular, the issue of whether the\r\nproposed licence was to be a “front” for Ms Aziz’s family members\r\nwhose previous applications had either been refused or withdrawn.\r\nRelevant documentation concerning those previous applications was\r\nattached to the call up letter, including a schedule of convictions.\r\n9. At the hearing before the TC, Ms Aziz was represented by Mr Bowling\r\nof the National Limousine & Chauffer Association. The TC made it\r\nclear from the outset that he was concerned about the issue of\r\n“fronting” arising out of Ms Aziz’s application. Mr Bowling began by\r\nsubmitting that in responses to pre-inquiry questions, Ms Aziz had been\r\n“open and honest” about her relationship with her brothers. However,\r\nshe was not fully “au fait” with the extent of her brothers convictions but\r\nshe had stated “clearly and unequivocally” that there would be a\r\n“cleaver in business between the family connections and work”. The\r\nonly common denominator was her father’s ownership of the operating\r\ncentre. She was the only member of the family without a business\r\ninterest of her own although she worked full time as an internal auditor\r\nfor a bank. That background meant that she was well aware of the\r\nconstraints and requirements of “laying audit trails and of keeping\r\nproper records”. Ms Aziz had identified a demand in the Asian\r\ncommunity for sixteen seat Hummers for use as wedding transport and\r\nfor other events.\r\n5\r\n10. Ms Aziz then gave evidence. She told the TC that she had been an\r\ninternal auditor for a bank for eight years. She was “now” more aware\r\nabout her brothers’ involvement with limousines but she did not have\r\nan in depth knowledge. The TC then read out sections of his decision\r\nconcerning Iqbal’s failed application. Ms Aziz stated that she was keen\r\nto keep her business separate from that of her brothers and was very\r\nindependent even though she lives in the same house as them, along\r\nwith her father. The TC was concerned about why Ms Aziz wanted to\r\nset up in business as a limousine operator when, as an intelligent and\r\narticulate woman with a “good job”, there were so many other business\r\nopportunities she could have chosen. Ms Aziz attempted to assure the\r\nTC that she had chosen limousine operation because she had seen\r\nhow the market operated and it was something she could easily\r\nundertake. Her brothers would not have anything to do with the\r\nvehicles and she would not employ them as PSV drivers. She did not\r\nknow the rules of drivers’ hours and tachographs but she planned to\r\nstudy for a drivers CPC. She was however able to answer some\r\nquestions put to her by the TC about drivers’ hours. She understood\r\nthat she had to satisfy the TC that her application was not a “front” for\r\nher brothers and father and she accepted that there were rogue traders\r\nwithin the industry, including her brothers. But she did not know what\r\nthey had done. Alarm bells did ring when she read the TC’s decision\r\nconcerning Iqbal’s application but their operating history was “their\r\npersonal matter”. The limousine business was a good and profitable\r\none which suited her circumstances being mostly weekend work and\r\nshe wanted to operate “the right way”. She denied that she would be\r\nusing one of the company’s vehicles on her licence. She accepted that\r\nshe had not researched how she was going to safeguard the business\r\nalthough she was happy to give an undertaking that her brothers would\r\nnot drive. Despite the fact that the company and her brothers operate\r\nfrom Milk Street, she had not considered nominating an alternative\r\noperating centre because the rent terms were very advantageous to\r\nher.\r\n11. In his closing remarks, Mr Bowling repeated that the business plan was\r\nto operate Hummer vehicles and that there would be a clear division\r\nbetween the operation of Ms Aziz and those of her family. He had\r\ndiscussed with Ms Aziz issues such as “tachograph training”. His main\r\nconcern was that the “sins of the father should not be attached to Miss\r\nAziz”. He was in no doubt that the application was a genuine one.\r\n12. In his oral decision, the TC accepted that Ms Aziz was intelligent,\r\narticulate and had standing in the local community and that she had a\r\nwell remunerated job which required a high degree of skill. The issue\r\nwith her application arose out of his gate keeping role within the PSV\r\nindustry. Whilst the “sins” of her family should not be held against her,\r\nthe TC was concerned that Ms Aziz had chosen the limousine business\r\nwithout undertaking the relevant research. He had substantial\r\nconcerns as to the involvement of her family in the proposed operation\r\nand the fact that she continued to live with her father and two brothers\r\n6\r\nwho are all in the limousine business. The suggestion that Ms Aziz’s\r\noperation would be separate from that of the company’s or her\r\nbrothers’ was not supported by any tangible evidence. If Ms Aziz’s\r\nproposed business was genuinely independent from that of her family,\r\nthen the TC would have expected evidence that she had undertaken a\r\nlot more research. In the circumstances, the TC could not be satisfied\r\nabout Ms Aziz’s good repute.\r\nUpper Tribunal Appeal\r\n13. Mr Bowling submitted an appeal on behalf of Ms Aziz. Whilst there\r\nwere four grounds of appeal, they all made the same complaint,\r\nnamely, that the TC’s view of Ms Aziz’s application was influenced by\r\nthe previous conduct of her family members and that consequently, he\r\nhad pre-determined her application prior to the hearing taking place\r\nand that he had wrongly made an adverse finding against her good\r\nrepute.\r\n14. At the hearing of the appeal, Mr Bowling repeated the above. He said\r\nthat Ms Aziz was upset by the TC finding that she lacked good repute.\r\nHe should have accepted that she was independent of her family\r\ndespite living in the same house as them and they would not influence\r\nher operational decisions. She was well able to establish and maintain\r\nan audit trail which would demonstrate that her proposed business\r\nwould be separate from the other family limousine businesses\r\noperating from the same operating centre. Mr Bowling complained that\r\nMs Aziz was not given any proper opportunity to put forward the type of\r\naudit trail that she would institute or indeed set out her case, as the TC\r\nkept interrupting her. It was accepted that Ms Aziz did not know how it\r\ncame to be that the family company and her brothers were convicted of\r\nserious criminal offences relating to the operation of a limousine and it\r\nwas further accepted that the call up letter had highlighted the need for\r\nher to address the concerns of the TC that her application was “a front”.\r\nThe Tribunal’s decision\r\n15. Dealing first with the submission that Ms Aziz was not given sufficient\r\nopportunity by the TC to set out her case, we are not satisfied that this\r\nwas so. The TC did interrupt her when she was giving evidence but\r\nthat was understandable against the background of an applicant who\r\nhad failed to ask any meaningful questions of her family about the\r\nunlawful operation of a limousine and the resulting convictions despite\r\nthe fact that she lives in the same house as the rest of her family and\r\nthe call up letter raised the issue in no uncertain terms. The TC rightly\r\nhad concerns about fronting and all that Ms Aziz could do was make\r\nbare assertions that her operation would be separate from those of her\r\nfather, Bilal and Iqbal. Towards the end of hearing, the TC asked Mr\r\nBowling whether he had any further questions of Ms Aziz to which Mr\r\n7\r\nBowling replied “no” and then prior to delivering his oral decision the\r\nTC asked Mr Bowling whether there was anything else he wanted to\r\nsay, to which he replied “no”. We are satisfied that Ms Aziz and Mr\r\nBowling were given adequate opportunities to state her case before the\r\nTC.\r\n16. So to the main issue in this appeal, we are not satisfied that the TC’s\r\napproach to Ms Aziz’s application indicated a pre-determination of the\r\nissues. It is plain that he was impressed with Ms Aziz as an individual\r\nbut he was also rightly concerned about her failure to properly\r\ndemonstrate that there was any “clear blue water” between her\r\napplication and the family businesses. It should have been abundantly\r\nclear to Ms Aziz that she had to do something more than merely rely\r\nupon her standing as a bank auditor whilst at the same time asserting\r\nthat, despite the fact that she was going to operate the proposed\r\nvehicle from the same premises as the businesses operated by her\r\nfather and brother, she would be entirely independent from them. The\r\nTribunal was struck by the fact that Ms Aziz failed to make any proper\r\nenquiry of her father and brothers as to how it came to be that an\r\nunlicensed limousine was operating without a COIF, insurance, MOT\r\nand tachograph whilst transporting a party of teenagers and further,\r\nhow it came to be that a document produced to the DVSA in an attempt\r\nto persuade the DVSA that the vehicle was operating under a dry hiring\r\nagreement, came to have a forged signature appended to it. Her\r\nfailure to make those enquiries demonstrates that Ms Aziz had failed to\r\nappreciate the required obligations and responsibilities of being a PSV\r\noperator and in turn had failed to establish that she was of good repute.\r\nNeither the law or the facts of this case impel the Tribunal to find that\r\nthe decision of the TC was wrong as per the test in Bradley Fold Travel\r\nLtd & Peter Wright v Secretary of State for Transport (2010) EWCA Civ.\r\n695.\r\n17. The appeal is dismissed.\r\nHer Honour Judge J Beech\r\n20 December 2016","tribunal_decision_categories":["transport-traffic-commissioner-and-doe-ni-appeals"],"tribunal_decision_decision_date":"2016-12-20","tribunal_decision_judges":["beech-j"],"tribunal_decision_sub_categories":["transport-traffic-commissioner-and-doe-ni-appeals-repute-fitness","transport-traffic-commissioner-and-doe-ni-appeals-restricted-licences"]},"max_cache_time":10,"temporary_update_type":false,"attachments":[{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/586b80aae5274a130700010b/T-2016-44_Sana_Aziz__3_.pdf","title":"T/44/2016","content_type":"application/pdf","updated_at":"2017-01-03T10:44:58+00:00","created_at":"2017-01-03T10:44:58+00:00","content_id":"64e66f65-77b4-4abf-8fbc-f120ec90da10"}],"headers":[{"text":"Judicial Summary","level":2,"id":"judicial-summary"}],"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2017-01-03T10:46:07.691Z"}]},"routes":[{"path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions/sana-aziz-2016-ukut-567-aac","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"specialist-publisher","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"utaac_decision","schema_name":"specialist_document","first_published_at":"2017-01-03T10:46:07Z","base_path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions/sana-aziz-2016-ukut-567-aac","description":"Upper Tribunal Administrative Appeals Chamber decision by Judge Beech on 20 December 2016.","content_id":"11c40185-9ff0-4da9-950b-ee8ced08d8f7","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"D18","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice","base_path":"/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice","content_id":"dcc907d6-433c-42df-9ffb-d9c68be5dc4d","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-07-18T17:26:49Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Ministry of Justice","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"ministry-of-justice","logo":{"formatted_title":"Ministry<br/>of Justice","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}},{"analytics_identifier":"EA73","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service","base_path":"/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service","content_id":"6f757605-ab8f-4b62-84e4-99f79cf085c2","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-02-21T14:12:20Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"HM Courts & Tribunals Service","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"ministry-of-justice","logo":{"formatted_title":"HM Courts &amp; <br/>Tribunals Service","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}},{"analytics_identifier":"PB1142","api_path":"/api/content/courts-tribunals/upper-tribunal-administrative-appeals-chamber","base_path":"/courts-tribunals/upper-tribunal-administrative-appeals-chamber","content_id":"4c2e325a-2d95-442b-856a-e7fb9f9e3cf8","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-06-18T16:08:53Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber)","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":null,"logo":{"formatted_title":"Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber)"}},"links":{}}],"finder":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions","base_path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions","content_id":"e9e7fcff-bb0d-4723-af25-9f78d730f6f8","description":"Find decisions on appeals to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber), including social security and child support appeals.","document_type":"finder","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-03-30T10:34:00Z","schema_name":"finder","title":"Administrative appeals tribunal decisions","withdrawn":false,"details":{"document_noun":"decision","filter":{"document_type":"utaac_decision"},"format_name":"Administrative appeals tribunal decision","show_summaries":true,"summary":"<p>Find decisions on appeals to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber), including social security and child support appeals.</p><p>This includes decisions made from January 2016 onwards.
