James Member of the Upper Tribunal\r\nMr J. Robinson Member of the Upper Tribunal\r\nAppellant: W Martin Oliver Partnership\r\nRespondent: Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA)\r\nOn Appeal From: Deputy Traffic Commissioner for the North East of\r\nEngland\r\nDetermination Date: 4 February 2016\r\nDETERMINATION ON AN APPLICATION TO ADDUCE FRESH EVIDENCE\r\nBackground\r\n1. On 2 July 2014 Vehicle Registration PO56DFG (‘the detained vehicle’)\r\nwas detained under regulation 3 of the Goods Vehicles (Enforcement\r\nPowers) Regulations 2001, as amended (‘the 2001 Regulations’).\r\n2. An application by the W Martin Oliver Partnership (‘the Appellant’)\r\nclaiming ownership and return of the detained vehicle, made under\r\nregulation 10 of the 2001 Regulations, was received in the office of the\r\nTraffic Commissioner, on 18 July 2014.\r\n3. An initial Hearing took place on 30 July 2014. On 22 September 2014\r\nthe application for the return of the detained vehicle was refused by the\r\nTraffic Commissioner for the North East of England. An appeal against\r\nthe decision dated 22 September 2014 was heard by the Upper\r\nTribunal on 27 February 2015. In a decision dated 5 March 2014 the\r\nUpper Tribunal allowed the appeal, remitted the case for re-hearing\r\nbefore the Traffic Commissioner and issued directions.\r\n4. On 20 May 2015 the application for the return of the detained vehicle\r\nwas refused by the Deputy Traffic Commissioner for the North East of\r\nEngland following a second Hearing on 13 May 2015. The Deputy\r\nTraffic Commissioner determined that the applicant had not satisfied\r\nhim in accordance with regulation 4(3)(a) that at the time the vehicle\r\nwas detained the user of the vehicle held a valid operator’s licence\r\n(whether or not authorising the use of the vehicle). The Deputy Traffic\r\nCommissioner directed that the Driver and Vehicle Services Agency\r\n(‘DVSA’) could dispose of the vehicle once the period for appeal had\r\nconcluded.\r\n5. On 17 June 2015 an appeal against the decision of the Deputy Traffic\r\nCommissioner dated 20 May 2015 was received in the office of the\r\nUpper Tribunal.\r\n6. The appeal was listed for oral hearing on 27 November 2015.\r\n7. On 18 November 2015 amended grounds of appeal and an application\r\nto adduce fresh evidence was received in the office of the Upper\r\nTribunal from Mr Tinkler, the Appellant’s Solicitor. The amended\r\ngrounds of appeal and application to adduce fresh evidence had been\r\nprepared by Mr Clarke, Counsel for the Appellant.\r\n8. It was noted that the fresh evidence was a report of an expert witness\r\nwhich was appended to the application. In the application itself, it was\r\nsubmitted that:\r\n‘… the evidence ought to be admitted in the interests of justice, in\r\nthat it:\r\na. Remedies the unfairness complained of in the\r\nAppellant’s Grounds of Appeal, and\r\nb. Demonstrates that the evidence given by Traffic\r\nExaminer Morrow on the topic was flawed.’\r\n9. The ‘evidence given by Traffic Examiner Morrow’ referred to in the\r\nsecond bullet point is oral evidence which was given by the Traffic\r\nExaminer during the course of a Public Inquiry held on 13 May 2015.\r\n10. On 18 November 2015 the two Specialist Members of the Tribunal\r\nwere requested not to consider the contents of the report of the expert\r\nwitness. They complied with that request. The report was also not\r\nconsidered by the Judge.\r\n11. On 23 November 2015 a Case Management Direction, which had been\r\nagreed with the Specialist Members of the Tribunal, was issued to the\r\nparties to the proceedings. In summary, it was directed that the\r\napplication to adduce fresh evidence was, at that stage, refused.\r\nCounsel for the Appellant was informed that the application could be\r\nrenewed at the oral hearing of the appeal and that if the application\r\nwas renewed, that the Upper Tribunal would be seeking submissions\r\non how the application complied with the general jurisprudence on the\r\nadmission of fresh evidence in tribunal proceedings and, in particular,\r\nhow that jurisprudence has been applied in the transport appellate\r\njurisdiction.\r\n12. The parties to the proceedings were also asked to note that the fresh\r\nevidence which was the subject of the relevant application had not\r\nbeen considered by the Upper Tribunal. It would only be so considered\r\nif any renewed application was successful.\r\n13. On 23 November 2015 three documents were received from Mr\r\nThomas who was representing the DVSA (‘the Respondent’). These\r\ndocuments were (i) a Skeleton Argument (ii) written submissions and\r\n(iii) a ‘Chronology’. The application to adduce fresh evidence was not\r\naddressed in any of these documents.\r\n14. On 25 November 2015 a further document headed ‘Skeleton Argument\r\non behalf of DVSA in response to amended Grounds of Appeal’ was\r\nreceived in the office of the Upper Tribunal from Mr Thomas. In this\r\ndocument, Mr Thomas submitted:\r\n‘In view of the preliminary ruling of the Tribunal not to admit new\r\nevidence that could have been adduced at the original hearing\r\nDVSA reserves its right to oppose any oral application by the\r\nAppellant to introduce any such evidence or in the alternative to\r\ncall rebuttal evidence.’\r\n15. On 25 November 2015 two substantive documents were received in\r\nthe office of the Upper Tribunal from Mr Tinkler. The first of these was\r\nheaded ‘Application to Adduce Fresh Evidence – Skeleton argument\r\nfor the Appellant’. This document had been prepared, once again, by\r\nMr Clarke. It set out, in some detail, arguments in support of a renewed\r\napplication in conformity with the terms of the Case Management\r\nDirection issued on 23 November 2015. The second document was\r\nheaded ‘Skeleton argument for the Appellant.’ This document was\r\nintended to be a reply to the Skeleton Argument received from Mr\r\nThomas on 23 November 2015.\r\n16. On 26 November 2015 e-mail correspondence was received in the\r\noffice of the Upper Tribunal from Mr Thomas. In this correspondence,\r\nMr Thomas submitted that:\r\n‘An application has been made to adduce fresh evidence.\r\nYesterday a skeleton argument was served on us. Because of\r\ncourt commitments we have not been able to prepare a\r\nresponse in reply and will make oral representations tomorrow.\r\nIn the meantime the only case law we will refer to is attached.\r\nBoth Transport Tribunal cases:\r\n1. Pedlow\r\n2. Thames Materials’\r\n17. The oral hearing took place on 27 November 2015. The Appellant was\r\nrepresented by Mr Clarke. The Respondent was represented by Mr\r\nThomas. The Tribunal, as a preliminary issue, heard oral arguments on\r\nthe application to adduce fresh evidence. The Tribunal rose to make its\r\ndetermination on the application and, following consideration, informed\r\nMr Clark that the application was refused. The Tribunal informed Mr\r\nClark that written reasons for the refusal would be issued, in due\r\ncourse.\r\n18. Following a consultation with his client, Mr Clarke made an application,\r\nunder rule 17(1)(b) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules\r\n2008 (‘the 2008 Rules’) to withdraw the appeal. The Upper Tribunal\r\nconsented to the withdrawal of the appeal under rule 17(2) of the 2008\r\nRules.\r\n19. On 7 January 2016 Mr Thomas made an application for a copy of the\r\nUpper Tribunal’s ‘decision’. The basis for the application was as\r\nfollows:\r\n‘Currently the vehicle is in the DVSA compound incurring daily\r\nstorage charges. Once the decision is received we will be in a\r\nposition to contact the Appellant’s representatives. If the matter\r\nis concluded at that stage DVSA can release the vehicle for\r\nsale.’\r\n20. On 12 January 2016 the clerk to the Upper Tribunal was informed that\r\nthe Appellant, at the oral hearing of the appeal, through his Counsel Mr\r\nClarke, had made an application to withdraw the appeal under rule\r\n17(1)(b) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and\r\nthat the Upper Tribunal consented to the withdrawal of the appeal\r\nunder rule 17 (2). The clerk was informed that, in these circumstances,\r\nthere was no requirement for a ‘decision’ as that term would normally\r\nbe understood but that a ‘Disposal Order’ had been prepared. The clerk\r\nwas advised that Rule 17(5) of the 2008 Rules provides that ‘The\r\nUpper Tribunal must notify each party in writing that a withdrawal has\r\ntaken effect.’ She was directed that Disposal Order should, therefore,\r\nbe issued to the parties.\r\n21. The effect of the withdrawal of the appeal was stated in the Disposal\r\nOrder to be that the decision of the Deputy Traffic Commissioner dated\r\n20 May 2015 remained extant. The practical effect was that the Deputy\r\nTraffic Commissioner’s direction that the detained vehicle could be\r\ndisposed of could then be implemented.\r\nThe submissions of the parties\r\n22. We are grateful to Mr Clarke for his carefully-prepared Skeleton\r\nArgument on the application to adduce fresh evidence and to Mr\r\nThomas and him for their oral submissions at the appeal hearing.\r\n23. In his Skeleton Argument Mr Clarke made reference to the Upper\r\nTribunal’s request for submissions on how the application complied\r\nwith the general jurisprudence in the admission of fresh evidence in\r\ntribunal proceedings and, in particular, how that jurisprudence had\r\nbeen applied in the transport appellate jurisdiction. Mr Clarke\r\nsubmitted, in addition, that it was appropriate to consider the more\r\nrecent jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal on the topic.\r\n24. In relation to the Tribunal’s approach, Mr Clarke set out Rule 15(2) of\r\nthe Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory\r\nChamber) Rules 2009 and noted that Rule 15(2) of the Tribunal\r\nProcedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 made an identical provision.\r\n25. Mr Clarke turned to the guidance which was given in the ‘Digest of\r\nDecisions on Appeal from Traffic Commissioners’1 (‘the Digest’) on the\r\nTribunal’s approach to applications to receive fresh evidence. He noted\r\nthat two factors were identified at page 101 of the Digest as being of\r\nrelevance to the issue but submitted that the first of these was not\r\nrelevant to the particular circumstances of this case. We return to that\r\nsubmission below. The second factor was identified in the Digest as\r\nfollows:\r\n‘Second, and subject to the first point, the tribunal has\r\nconsistently followed the practice of the Court of Appeal when\r\ndeciding whether or not to admit fresh evidence.’\r\n26. Mr Clarke referred to the decision of the then Transport Tribunal in\r\nThames Materials Ltd (2002/40). It is important to note that this\r\ndecision is cited in the Digest as setting out the tribunal’s practice and\r\napproach to the admission of new evidence on appeal. Mr Clarke\r\nreferred to paragraph 7 of the decision:\r\n‘In deciding whether or not to admit fresh evidence the Tribunal\r\nhas consistently applied the conditions laid down by the Court of\r\nAppeal in Ladd v. Marshall (1954) 1 WLR 1489, …….The\r\nrelevant Ladd v. Marshall conditions, bearing in mind the\r\nprohibition on taking into account circumstances which did not\r\nexist at the time of the determination subject to appeal, are as\r\nfollows:-\r\n(i) The fresh evidence must be admissible evidence.\r\n(ii) It must be evidence which could not have been obtained, with\r\nreasonable diligence, for use at the public inquiry.\r\n(iii) It must be evidence such that, if given, it would probably\r\nhave had an important influence on the result of the case,\r\nthough it does not have to be shown that it would have been\r\ndecisive.\r\n(iv) It must be evidence which is apparently credible though not\r\nnecessarily incontrovertible.\r\n1 https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/tc-digest-aug-2014-revision.pdf\r\nWe would have thought that the first condition hardly needed to\r\nbe stated but it is quite apparent from the terms of Mr Clarke’s\r\nstatement that it needs to be stressed. There are authorities\r\nwhich indicate that condition (ii) is the critical condition.’\r\n27. Mr Clarke turned to Ladd v Marshall itself. He referred to the following\r\nstatement of Denning LJ (as he then was) setting out the test in\r\nunequivocal terms:\r\n‘The principles to be applied are the same as those always\r\napplied when fresh evidence is sought to be introduced. To\r\njustify the reception of fresh evidence or a new trial, three\r\nconditions must be fulfilled: first, it must be shown that the\r\nevidence could not have been obtained with reasonable\r\ndiligence for use at the trial; secondly, the evidence must be\r\nsuch that, if given, it would probably have an important influence\r\non the result of the case, though it need not be decisive; thirdly,\r\nthe evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed, or\r\nin other words, it must be apparently credible, though it need not\r\nbe incontrovertible.’\r\n28. Mr Clarke noted that the principles in Thames Materials were most\r\nrecently considered in the decision of the Upper Tribunal in Cornwall\r\nBusways Limited (2015 UKUT 0314 (AAC), T/2015/10) in ‘… which the\r\nTribunal reaffirmed the approach in Thames Materials’. We would note,\r\nat this stage, that the former Transport Tribunal, has consistently\r\nendorsed the approach set out in Thames Materials – see the decision\r\nof the Tribunal in 2002/75 Hazco Environmental Services at paragraph\r\n4 and 2005/118 M&J Tinworth at paragraph 3.\r\n29. Mr Clarke then turned to the approach of the Court of Appeal to the\r\nquestion of the proper approach to applications to adduce fresh\r\nevidence noting that ‘… clearly matters have moved on from when the\r\ndecision in Ladd v Marshall was handed down.’ Conceding that the\r\nTribunal had consistently followed the practice of the Court of Appeal,\r\nMr Clarke submitted that the Appellant relied on the test in his\r\narguments before us.\r\n30. Mr Clarke noted that the ‘highest hurdle’ for the admission of fresh\r\nevidence was to be found in the test for criminal appeals as set out in\r\nsection 23 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. He made reference to the\r\nobservations of Lord Judge CJ at paragraph 39 of the decision in R v\r\nErskine (2010) 1 All ER 1196, as follows:\r\n‘… virtually by definition, the decision whether to admit fresh\r\nevidence is case and fact specific. The discretion to receive\r\nfresh evidence is a wide one focussing on the interests of\r\njustice.‘\r\n31. Mr Clarke submitted the Court of Appeal in R v Chattoo ([2012] EWCA\r\nCrim 190) provided a summary of the principles to be applied when\r\ndeciding whether or not to receive expert evidence under section 23.\r\nHe asserted that the test for the admission of fresh evidence could be\r\nstated as follows:\r\n‘a. Is the fresh evidence\r\ni. capable of belief;\r\nii. capable of founding a ground of appeal;\r\niii. admissible in the proceedings from which the appeal lies; and\r\nb. is there a reasonable explanation for the failure to adduce\r\nthe evidence in the [court] below.’\r\n32. Mr Clarke submitted that in the circumstances of the present case all\r\nfour tests were satisfied. At this stage, we set out Mr Clarke’s\r\nsubmissions in connection with limb ‘b’ above, namely whether there is\r\n‘… a reasonable explanation for the failure to adduce the evidence.’ Mr\r\nClarke stated:\r\n‘Proceedings before the Traffic Commissioner are No-cost\r\nproceedings, conducted in an environment in which those\r\nappearing before the Traffic Commissioners are encouraged to\r\nappear in person. That is why such proceedings are conducted\r\non an informal inquiry basis.\r\nThis Public Inquiry was conducted by the Appellant in person;\r\nthe DVSA were represented by a very capable solicitor. Whilst it\r\nis not suggested that the Appellant was in any way misled, he\r\nclearly did not have the legal knowledge to identify and litigate\r\nthe points raised in this appeal. Given that the earlier appeal\r\nTribunal had directed as it did on the issue of technical\r\nevidence, it is unsurprising that the Appellant did not seek expert\r\nevidence on the topic: as far as he knew, the DVSA had not\r\nsought to rely upon any technical evidence. Thus it need not\r\n“……be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained\r\nwith reasonable diligence for use at the trial…..” (Denning LJ in\r\nLadd v. Marshall) for he was not on notice as to the issue.’\r\n33. Mr Clarke added that if the submissions thus far were:\r\n‘… insufficient of itself to persuade the Tribunal to admit the\r\nfresh evidence, and accepting the general reluctance on the part\r\nof the Tribunal to admit evidence without a reasonable\r\nexplanation for the failure to adduce the evidence below, we\r\ninvite the Tribunal to bear in mind that the ultimate test for\r\nadmission of evidence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, s.\r\n23, is whether it is in the interests of justice to do so. In\r\nexceptional circumstances that Court has admitted fresh\r\nevidence in the absence of a reasonable explanation for the\r\nfailure to adduce it at trial: see R. v. Solomon [2007] EWCA Crim\r\n2633 at paragraphs 19, 25 and 31 of the judgement of Lord\r\nPhillips CJ.\r\nIn that respect it is submitted that the fresh evidence would have\r\nmade a difference to the outcome of, at least, the Deputy Traffic\r\nCommissioner’s ruling on those particular topics; for the fresh\r\nevidence demonstrates that Mr Morrow was incorrect on a\r\nnumber of important points upon which the Deputy Traffic\r\nCommissioner placed reliance.’\r\n34. At the oral hearing on 27 November 2015, Mr Clarke submitted that\r\nlimbs (i) and (iv) in the Ladd v Marshall test, namely that the fresh\r\nevidence must be admissible evidence and that it must be evidence\r\nwhich is apparently credible though not necessarily incontrovertible\r\nwere satisfied in this case. Mr Thomas agreed with that submission.\r\n35. Mr Clarke expanded on the arguments which he had made in his\r\nSkeleton Argument. He resubmitted that matters had moved on since\r\n1954 and the decision in Ladd v Marshall. The emphasis was on the\r\ninterests of justice as an exception to the general principle. The general\r\nprinciple was now subject to a more generous interpretation. He\r\nsubmitted that a decision not to admit the fresh evidence in this case\r\nwould give rise to an injustice. He repeated that the Court of Appeal\r\nhad in exceptional circumstances admitted fresh evidence in the\r\nabsence of a reasonable explanation for the failure to adduce it at the\r\ntrial.\r\n36. In respect of limb (ii) of the Ladd v Marshall test, Mr Clarke submitted\r\nthat the focus had to be on diligence in the sense that the evidence\r\ncould have been obtained. Mr Clarke re-emphasised the points which\r\nhe had made in his Skeleton Argument concerning the nature of the\r\nproceedings before the Traffic Commissioner, in particular the Public\r\nInquiry; that there was no requirement for legal representation in such\r\nproceedings and that those who appear are encouraged to do so in\r\nperson; that in the particular circumstances of the case the Appellant\r\nwas not put on notice that he would require expert evidence; and the\r\nAppellant, at all stages, was a litigant and not a lawyer.\r\n37. In respect of limb (iii) of the Ladd v Marshall test, Mr Clarke made\r\nreference to sub-paragraph (o) of paragraph 68 of the decision of the\r\nDeputy Traffic Commissioner. The findings made in paragraph 68 were\r\nsupplemented by the reasoning in paragraph 72. The reasoning there\r\nwent to the credibility of Mr Gary George, who was said to be the\r\noperator of the vehicle, with consequences beyond the remit of the\r\nPublic Inquiry. The Deputy Traffic Commissioner had used his findings\r\nto found his decision. The findings were based on an assessment of\r\ncertain evidence which was incorrect. The fresh evidence challenged\r\nthe evidence which was given by Traffic Examiner Morrow. The Deputy\r\nTraffic Commissioner might have arrived at a different decision had he\r\nhad the benefit of the fresh evidence before him.\r\n38. In his submissions on limb (ii) of Ladd v Marshall, Mr Thomas noted\r\nthat the Appellant had been through regulatory proceedings before. He\r\nreferred to a previous decision of the Upper Tribunal dated 5 March\r\n2015, to which the appellant had been a party, and, in particular, to\r\nparagraphs 26 and 27 of that decision. Mr Thomas also referred to\r\ncorrespondence dated 12 March 2015 which had been sent to Mr\r\nGeorge and to the statement of the Traffic Examiner dated 17 March\r\n2015. Mr Thomas submitted that it could not be said that the Appellant\r\nwas unaware of the nature of proceedings or of the issues which had\r\narisen. Mr Thomas also referred to correspondence dated 13 March\r\n2015 from Mr George to the Senior Traffic Examiner which was\r\nprepared but which was never sent.\r\n39. In relation to limb (iii) of Ladd v Marshall, Mr Thomas submitted that\r\nwhen the case was looked at as a whole the admission of the further\r\nevidence could have no bearing on the case. Mr Thomas made\r\nreference to paragraph 71 of the decision of the Deputy Traffic\r\nCommissioner and his reasoning in paragraph 73.\r\nAnalysis\r\n40. We begin by considering the proper approach to be adopted when the\r\nUpper Tribunal, in an appeal against a decision of a Traffic\r\nCommissioner, is met with an application by a party to the proceedings\r\nto adduce new or fresh evidence. We have no hesitation in confirming\r\nthat the proper approach is as set out in the decision of the then\r\nTransport Tribunal in Thames Materials and confirmed by the Upper\r\nTribunal in Cornwall Busways Limited. We have already noted that the\r\ndecision in Thames Materials has a conclusive basis in the decision of\r\nthe Court of Appeal in Ladd v Marshall. Further, we have noted that the\r\nformer Transport Tribunal has been consistent in its application of the\r\nprinciples in Thames Materials.\r\n41. The appellate structure in the transport jurisdiction was the subject of\r\nsignificant revision with the implementation of the Tribunals, Courts and\r\nEnforcement Act 2007. Appeals from decisions of the Traffic\r\nCommissioner lie to the Upper Tribunal – see Article 7(a)(viii) of the\r\nFirst-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal (Chambers) Order 2008. At that\r\nstage there was an opportunity to revisit the jurisprudence of the former\r\nTransport Tribunal to determine whether that jurisprudence remained\r\nappropriate or required revision in light of the new tribunal appellate\r\nstructure or in light of other procedural developments. In respect of the\r\nprocedure to be adopted for applications to adduce fresh evidence, the\r\nUpper Tribunal endorsed the former procedure of the Transport\r\nTribunal relying on its consistency and coherency – see Cornwall\r\nBusways Limited.\r\n42. Mr Clarke asked us to look at the present approach of the Court of\r\nAppeal arguing that while the Transport and Upper Tribunals have\r\nconsistently followed the practice of that Court, things have moved on\r\nsince the promulgation of the decision in Ladd v Marshall in 1954. We\r\nhave noted that Mr Clarke has relied on a discrete legislative provision\r\n– section 23 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 - permitting the Court of\r\nAppeal to receive evidence if certain conditions are met. Mr Clarke\r\ndescribes the section 23 tests as representing the ‘highest hurdle’ for\r\nadmission of fresh evidence. In our view there is a reason why there\r\nshould be a specific test for the admission of fresh evidence in criminal\r\nappeals which is the avoidance of miscarriages of justice and the\r\nunlawful deprivation of the liberty of an individual. In R v Pendleton\r\n([2002] 1 All ER 524), Lord Bingham set out the following background\r\nto the modern legislative scheme for criminal appeals stating, at page\r\n528:\r\n‘The Criminal Appeal Act 1907 did not intend to undermine the\r\ntraditional role of the trial jury but did intend to arm the new\r\nCourt of Criminal Appeal with powers sufficient to rectify\r\nmiscarriages of justice, of which there had been notorious recent\r\nexamples.’\r\nHe added, at page 529:\r\n‘Although the 1907 Act has been repeatedly amended, the\r\nscheme of the Act has not been fundamentally altered … In s 23\r\nof the 1968 Act, as amended, s 9 of the 1907 Act has been both\r\nsimplified and elaborated.’\r\n43. There is, accordingly, a specific and definite purpose to the legislative\r\nprovisions for criminal appeals and the discrete provision relating to the\r\npresenting of fresh evidence. The issues in the present appeal,\r\ninvolving as they do the dispossession of their property, are of the\r\ngreatest significance for the Appellant. This is not, however, a criminal\r\nappeal. It is our view that legislative provisions relating to such appeals,\r\nand judicial interpretation of those provisions, are not applicable in this\r\ncase. We are reinforced in that view by the fact this Tribunal and its\r\npredecessor have been consistent in their application of an approach to\r\napplications to adduce fresh evidence which has not been arrogated or\r\nconsidered to be inappropriate or erroneous.\r\n44. If we are wrong in the conclusions arrived at in the preceding\r\nparagraph we would argue that, in any event, we are not satisfied that\r\nthe test in section 23(1)(d), namely that there is a reasonable\r\nexplanation for the failure to adduce the evidence is satisfied. Equally\r\nwe do not consider that there are exceptional circumstances which\r\nwould permit the admission of the fresh evidence in the absence of a\r\nreasonable explanation for the failure to adduce it.\r\n45. For the record, therefore, we repeat that the test to be applied is\r\nwhether the following conditions are met:\r\n‘(i) The fresh evidence must be admissible evidence.\r\n(ii) It must be evidence which could not have been obtained,\r\nwith reasonable diligence, for use at the public inquiry.\r\n(iii) It must be evidence such that, if given, it would probably\r\nhave had an important influence on the result of the case,\r\nthough it does not have to be shown that it would have\r\nbeen decisive.\r\n(iv) It must be evidence which is apparently credible though\r\nnot necessarily incontrovertible.’\r\n46. As was noted above, at the oral hearing, Mr Thomas conceded that\r\nlimbs (i) and (iv) are met in this case. Although we have not considered\r\nthe content of the expert report, we are content to accept that\r\nconcession. Attention turns, therefore, to limbs (ii) and (iii).\r\n47. In connection with limb (ii) Mr Clarke’s argument that it is satisfied is\r\ncentred on the nature of the proceedings within which the Appellant\r\nhas become involved. Those proceedings, he argues, are inquisitorial,\r\ninformal and where parties are prompted towards self-representation.\r\nFurther, the Appellant, as a non-legally qualified layperson, did not\r\nappreciate the requirement nor was put on notice to (i) prepare and\r\nrespond to technical issues arising in the proceedings (ii) seek advice\r\nand guidance on the issues which did arise and (iii) pursue assistance\r\nthrough legal representation. In those circumstances he was not\r\nattentive to the fact that there could be evidence which had the\r\npotential to be adverse to him. If he had that awareness or been put on\r\nnotice, then he could have sought the evidence which he now wished\r\nto submit.\r\n48. We are of the view that there might have been greater force in Mr\r\nClarke’s arguments had the Appellant been a novice in transport\r\nregulatory proceedings. It is our experience that those who are\r\nparticipating in such proceedings for the first time are often unsettled by\r\nthe experience when it turns out to be more unfamiliar and\r\ndisconcerting than they anticipated despite the best efforts of those\r\nconducting the proceedings to adopt an enabling and non-adversarial\r\nrole.\r\n49. In this case, however, the chronology demonstrates that the relevant\r\nvehicle was impounded on 2 July 2014. In detailed correspondence\r\nsent from the office of the DVSA the Appellant was advised of the legal\r\nand evidential basis for the impounding. The Appellant sought the\r\nreturn of the vehicle on 18 July 2014 by completion of the relevant\r\nforms. A Hearing took place on 30 July 2014. The Appellant was\r\nprovided with formal notification of the Hearing and was informed of his\r\nright to be legally represented. The Appellant was present at the\r\nHearing but was not represented. Subsequently the Traffic\r\nCommissioner issued a decision refusing the application for the return\r\nof the impounded vehicle. The written reasons for the decision provide\r\na summary of the Hearing and note that the Appellant took an active\r\nparticipation in it. The written reasons set out the legal and evidential\r\nbasis for the Traffic Commissioner’s decision.\r\n50. The Appellant was dissatisfied with the Traffic Commissioner’s\r\ndecision. He exercised his right to appeal to the Upper Tribunal. He\r\ncompleted and returned the relevant forms. His grounds of appeal and\r\nwritten submission to the Upper Tribunal were prepared in some detail.\r\nThe grounds of appeal are comprehensive in their challenge to the\r\nTraffic Commissioner’s findings and conclusions.\r\n51. The Appellant attended an oral hearing of the appeal accompanied by\r\nMr George. The decision of the Upper Tribunal (2015 UKUT 113\r\n(AAC), T/2014/71) records that the Appellant and Mr George made\r\nsubmissions and wished to give evidence. The evidence and\r\nsubmissions related to the downloading of data. The Upper Tribunal\r\nallowed the appeal and directed that case be remitted to a different\r\nTraffic Commissioner to be re-heard, with clear directions as to what\r\nwas to be done by the Appellant, Mr George and, if appropriate, the\r\nDVSA. The Appellant was provided with a copy of the decision of the\r\nUpper Tribunal.\r\n52. We are of the view that if, at the outset of the regulatory proceedings\r\nleading to impounding of his vehicle, the Appellant was unaware of the\r\nnature of the pending proceedings, the extent of the regulatory regime\r\nfor transport, the grounding of that regulation in legislation, the role and\r\nfunction of Traffic Commissioners, the appellate oversight of the upper\r\nTribunal and, more significantly, the nature of the issues which were\r\narising and which required to be addressed, he should, by the time he\r\nreceived the decision of the Upper Tribunal, have gained the relevant\r\ninsight.\r\n53. In our view, the outcome of the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal\r\nand, more importantly, the consequences for the further Hearing and\r\ndecision-making by the Traffic Commissioner, were judiciously and\r\nself-evidently described by the Upper Tribunal in its decision. In\r\nparagraphs 25 to 27, the Upper Tribunal stated the following:\r\n’25. It was clear to the tribunal that, as a consequence of the new\r\nissues raised, new evidence was emerging from the\r\napplicant and from Mr George which was challenged by\r\nthe DVSA, and which was likely to lead to crossexamination\r\nand the possible need for further\r\ninvestigation and expert rebuttal evidence. This led to the\r\nobvious potential for unfairness - and in circumstances\r\nwhereby the applicant and Mr George had not been given any\r\nproper opportunity to deal with the new issues arising at a\r\nproperly convened first-instance hearing, on notice, before the\r\nTraffic Commissioner.\r\n26. We have considered whether to remit the matter back to the\r\nsame Traffic Commissioner or to a different Traffic\r\nCommissioner. Ideally, we would send the matter back to the\r\nsame Traffic Commissioner to hold a further hearing in\r\norder to make findings of fact in relation to the vehicle\r\ndigital data, once the partnership or Mr George has had a\r\nproper opportunity to produce it, and - if it is not\r\nproduced - to examine and test any explanations for its\r\nnon-production, to draw such inferences as are\r\nappropriate, and to finally decide the matter taking\r\naccount of all the evidence. However, having regard to the\r\nfact that the Traffic Commissioner said, at the conclusion of\r\nthe hearing, that the vehicle was unlikely to be returned, and\r\nto the subsequent negative judgments he made about Mr\r\nGeorge, we think that fairness requires that the matter be\r\nremitted, to be heard again, ab initio, by a different Traffic\r\nCommissioner.\r\n27. The appeal is allowed. We remit the matter back to be\r\nreheard. Mr George should be given a proper opportunity\r\nto produce the vehicle digital data for PO56DFG, or to\r\nprovide an evidentially supported explanation for his\r\ninability to do so and to face cross-examination thereon.\r\nIf the DVSA wish to present any technical evidence that\r\nno operator downloads of vehicle data can possibly\r\nhave taken place between 24/6/2013 and 11/7/2014, then\r\nsuch evidence should be served in advance of the\r\nhearing, so that the applicant has an opportunity to deal\r\nwith it before a decision is made.’\r\n54. The emphasis in each of these paragraphs is our own. The decision of\r\nthe Upper Tribunal was issued on 5 March 2015, over two months\r\nbefore the second Hearing before the Deputy Traffic Commissioner.\r\n55. What should the Appellant have learned from this? From paragraph 25,\r\nthe Appellant should have learned that there was a recognition that\r\nthere had been a procedural unfairness in the manner in which the first\r\nHearing had been conducted. The highlighted finding in paragraph 25\r\nshould have alerted the Appellant to the fact the emerging evidence\r\ncould be the subject of challenge and that he may have to meet that\r\nchallenge with his own expert rebuttal evidence.\r\n56. From paragraph 26, the Appellant should have learned that there was\r\ngoing to be a new Hearing. More significantly, he was informed that the\r\npurpose of the Hearing was to make findings of fact in relation to the\r\nvehicle digital data. He was also being given the opportunity, together\r\nwith Mr George, to produce the vehicle digital data and was informed\r\nthat if he failed to produce that data, the Traffic Commissioner would\r\nexamine any explanation for its non-production and, importantly, draw\r\nany inferences which were necessary and finally make a decision on\r\nthe basis of all of the evidence which was before him. The purpose and\r\noutcomes of the new Hearing could not have been more accurately or\r\ncarefully described.\r\n57. From paragraph 27, the Appellant should have learned that Mr George\r\nwas being given the opportunity to produce the vehicle digital data or\r\nan evidentially supported explanation of any failure to do so. The\r\nAppellant was informed that Mr George might face cross-examination\r\nat the new Hearing on any explanation of a failure to provide the\r\nrelevant data. Finally the Appellant was informed that DVSA might want\r\nto produce technical evidence and, if it wished to do so, that such\r\nevidence should be served on him. Once again the instructions were\r\nsuccinct and clear.\r\n58. On 12 March 2015, immediately following the issue of the decision of\r\nthe Upper Tribunal, the DVSA wrote directly to the Appellant and Mr\r\nGeorge directing them to produce digital tachograph downloads for the\r\nrelevant vehicle and were informed of the legislative basis for the\r\nrequirement and the consequences of a failure to comply with the\r\ndirection. The response of the Appellant was to ignore the\r\ncorrespondence. Mr George prepared a response dated 13 March\r\n2015 but failed to forward it. Subsequently he wrote to the DVSA on 19\r\nMay 2015 stating:\r\n‘I am currently acquiring information to support my\r\nexplanation as per the request of the Upper Tribunal.’\r\n59. The Appellant was also provided with an updated statement from the\r\nTraffic Examiner.\r\n60. Finally, the Appellant was notified of the date and time of the new\r\nHearing before the Traffic Commissioner and, once again, was\r\ninformed of his right to be legally represented. Further the\r\ncorrespondence reminded him that the Upper Tribunal had requested\r\nthat vehicle digital downloads be produced or, in the absence of their\r\nproduction, an evidentially supported explanation as to why production\r\nwas not possible.\r\n61. The new Hearing took place on 13 May 2015. The appellant was not\r\nrepresented and was accompanied by Mr George. At the outset of the\r\nHearing the Deputy Traffic Commissioner confirmed with the Appellant\r\nthat he was not represented and was content to proceed without\r\nrepresentation. He noted that the DVSA was represented by a solicitor.\r\nThe Appellant was asked whether he had any documentation which he\r\nwished to serve and he replied that he had not. The Appellant was\r\ngiven the opportunity to ask the Traffic Examiner questions after the\r\nTraffic Examiner had given his oral evidence.\r\n62. A copy of the decision of the Deputy Traffic Commissioner was sent to\r\nthe Appellant on 21 May 2015. In the covering correspondence the\r\nAppellant was advised of his right to appeal to the Upper Tribunal. The\r\nAppellant exercised that right through the submission of an appeal form\r\nwhich was received in the office of the Upper Tribunal on 17 June\r\n2015. In the appeal form the appellant indicated that he did not have a\r\nrepresentative. The grounds of appeal are detailed and included a\r\nchallenge to the conclusions of the Deputy Traffic Commissioner in\r\nconnection with the evidence which had been given by the officers from\r\nDVSA. There was no suggestion that he planned to produce expert\r\nrebuttal evidence in that regard.\r\n63. The appeal was listed for oral hearing on 27 November 2015. On 18\r\nNovember 2015 the application to adduce fresh evidence was received\r\nin the office of the Upper Tribunal.\r\n64. In our view, the Appellant’s attitude towards the regulatory and\r\nappellate proceedings, during the course of two Hearings before the\r\nTraffic and Deputy Traffic Commissioner and an initial hearing before\r\nthe Upper Tribunal, was characterised by indifference and\r\ninattentiveness rather than diligence and conscientiousness. Despite\r\nthe clear and precise terms of the remittal by the Upper Tribunal, and\r\nsubsequent correspondence outlining the production requirements for\r\nthe second Hearing, the response of the Appellant (and Mr George as\r\nan interested party) was to ignore the specifics of what they had to do\r\nto challenge the basis of the impounding of his vehicle.\r\n65. By the time of the second Hearing before the Deputy Traffic\r\nCommissioner, the Appellant should have been aware of the nature\r\nand form of the proceedings, the legal and evidential basis of the\r\ndecision to seize his vehicle, and the requirements to address the\r\ntechnical and other issues arising in the case. The Upper Tribunal was\r\nspecific in alerting the Appellant and Mr George to the requirement to\r\nproduce digital tachograph downloads for the relevant vehicle and\r\nwarning that in the absence of their production that an evidentially\r\nsupported explanation as to why production was not possible was\r\nneeded. The Appellant was cautioned that a failure to produce either\r\nthe downloads themselves or an appropriate explanation could lead to\r\nthe drawing of adverse inferences. Further, the Upper Tribunal made a\r\ndiscrete reference to the potential requirement for expert rebuttal\r\nevidence.\r\n66. By the date of the receipt of the decision of the Upper Tribunal, the\r\nAppellant should have been alert to the requirement to get assistance\r\nwith the unfolding proceedings either in the form of legal representation\r\nor expert evidence. The application to adduce the fresh evidence, in\r\nthe form of expert rebuttal evidence, is based on a submission that the\r\nAppellant understood the regulatory proceedings to be typified by\r\ninformality and self-representation. It is submitted that his failure to\r\nadduce the relevant evidence at the time of the second Hearing was\r\nbased on ‘… lack of knowledge to identify and litigate the points\r\narising’. With respect to that submission, it is rejected because it is our\r\nview that the Appellant, by the date of the second Hearing, had the\r\nrelevant points identified for them several weeks beforehand and was\r\nalerted to the appropriateness of producing the type of evidence which\r\nis the subject of the application. It is also submitted that given the terms\r\nof the Upper Tribunal’s remittal, ‘… it is unsurprising that the appellant\r\ndid not seek expert evidence on the topic.’ In our view, the terms of the\r\nremittal were such that the Appellant should have been on alert to seek\r\nsuch evidence.\r\n67. We are satisfied, therefore, that limb (ii) of the Ladd v Marshall is not\r\nmet in this case. The expert rebuttal evidence which is the subject of\r\nthe present application is evidence that could have been obtained, with\r\nreasonable diligence, for use at the public inquiry.\r\n68. Our conclusions on limb (ii) are sufficient to dispose of the application\r\nto adduce fresh evidence. We would note, however, that although we\r\nhave not considered, in detail, whether limb (iii) is satisfied, our\r\nconclusion is that it is not. As was noted above, limb (iii) is that the\r\nevidence ‘… must be that, if given, it would probably have had an\r\nimportant influence on the result of the case, though it does not have to\r\nbe shown that it would have been decisive..’\r\n69. We have not considered the fresh evidence at all. Mr Clarke informed\r\nus that it was in the nature of a report from an expert witness and goes\r\nto and challenges the evidence given at the second Hearing by a\r\nTraffic Examiner. Mr Clarke submits that the evidence would have\r\nmade a difference to the rulings of the Deputy Traffic Commissioner on\r\ncertain points and in connection with which the Commissioner placed\r\nreliance on the evidence of the Traffic Examiner.\r\n70. Looking at the totality of the decision of the Deputy Traffic\r\nCommissioner and, in particular, his findings of fact at paragraph 68, in\r\nour view it could not be said that the decision was ‘plainly wrong’ see\r\nthe decision of the Upper Tribunal in NT/2013/52 & 53 Fergal Hughes v\r\nDOENI & Perry McKee Homes Ltd v DOENI, at paragraph 8. The\r\nfindings and reasoning of the Deputy Traffic Commissioner, excising\r\nthe limited reasoning on the evidence of the Traffic Examiner, are more\r\nthan sufficient to support the decision which was reached.\r\n71. For the sake of completeness, we return to the submissions which\r\nwere made by Mr Clarke on section 23 of the Criminals Appeal Act\r\n1968 and associated jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal. As was\r\nnoted above, it is our view that legislative provisions relating to such\r\nappeals, and judicial interpretation of those provisions, are not\r\napplicable in this case. We noted, however, that if we are wrong in that\r\nconclusion we would argue that, in any event, we are not satisfied,\r\nfirstly, that the test in section 23(1)(d), namely that there is a\r\nreasonable explanation for the failure to adduce the evidence is\r\nsatisfied. For the reasons which we have set out in relation to limb (ii)\r\nof the Ladd v Marshall test, we are satisfied that we have not been\r\nprovided with a reasonable explanation for the failure to adduce the\r\nevidence arising from the decision of the Upper Tribunal and before the\r\nsecond Hearing took place.\r\n72. Equally we do not consider that there are exceptional circumstances\r\nwhich would permit the admission of the fresh evidence in the absence\r\nof a reasonable explanation for the failure to adduce it. In E and R v\r\nSecretary of State for the Home Department ([2004] EWCA Civ 49) (‘E\r\nand R’), Carnwath LJ, at paragraph 91, indicated that the principles in\r\nLadd v Marshall could also be departed from ‘… in exceptional\r\ncircumstances where the interests of justice require.’\r\n73. We do not consider that in this case, there are exceptional\r\ncircumstances where the interests of justice require a departure from\r\nthe Ladd v Marshall principles. We note that in Al-Mehdawi ([1990] 1\r\nAC 876, [1989] 3 All ER 843) the Court of Appeal refused to depart\r\nfrom those principles in a case involving deportation. The facts of the\r\ncase are not wholly analogous but the approach to circumstances in\r\nwhich a departure from the principles is justified, is instructive. Lord\r\nBridge concluded, at page 901:\r\n‘But I would add that, if once unfairness suffered by one party to\r\na dispute in consequence of some failure by his own advisers in\r\nrelation to the conduct of the relevant proceedings was admitted\r\nas a ground on which the High Court in the exercise of its\r\nsupervisory jurisdiction over inferior tribunals could quash the\r\nrelevant decision, I can discern no principle which could be\r\ninvoked to distinguish between a \"fundamental unfairness,\"\r\nwhich would justify the exercise of the jurisdiction, and a less\r\nthan fundamental unfairness, which would not … I am of the\r\nopinion that the decision of the Court of Appeal can only be\r\nsupported at the cost of opening such a wide door which would\r\nindeed seriously undermine the principle of finality in decision\r\nmaking.\r\nThe effect of this conclusion in a deportation case may appear\r\nharsh, though no harsher than the perhaps more common case\r\nwhen an immigrant's solicitor fails to give notice of appeal under\r\nsection 15 within the time limited by rule 4 of the Rules of 1984.’\r\n74. Finally, we have noted that Mr Clarke made reference, without\r\nexpansion, to Rule 15(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal)\r\n(General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 and the parallel Rule 15(2)\r\nof the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. With respect,\r\nwe do not understand the relevance of General Regulatory Chamber\r\nRules. The Upper Tribunal rules, which do apply to us, are, of course,\r\nsubject to the general ‘fresh evidence’ principles which we have set out\r\nabove.\r\nKenneth Mullan, Judge of the Upper Tribunal\r\n4 February 2016","tribunal_decision_categories":["transport-traffic-commissioner-and-doe-ni-appeals"],"tribunal_decision_decision_date":"2016-02-04","tribunal_decision_judges":["mullan-k"],"tribunal_decision_sub_categories":["transport-traffic-commissioner-and-doe-ni-appeals-impounding"],"bulk_published":true},"max_cache_time":10,"temporary_update_type":false,"attachments":[{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57835b41ed915d622c0000fb/T_2015_36_Martin_Oliver_Partnership_Fresh_Evidence_Determination__3_.pdf","title":"T/36/2015","content_type":"application/pdf","updated_at":"2016-07-11T08:39:29Z","created_at":"2016-07-11T08:39:29Z","content_id":"695bb25b-c7dd-4734-92ee-404caa61c334"}],"change_history":[{"note":"First published.","public_timestamp":"2016-12-01T16:20:19.065Z"}]},"routes":[{"path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions/w-martin-oliver-partnership-2016-ukut-70-aac","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"specialist-publisher","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"utaac_decision","schema_name":"specialist_document","first_published_at":"2016-12-01T16:20:19Z","base_path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions/w-martin-oliver-partnership-2016-ukut-70-aac","description":"Upper Tribunal Administrative Appeals Chamber decision by Judge Mullan on 4 February 2016.","content_id":"a6f3b0de-197a-4069-b1f2-af5b5576a9d7","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"D18","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice","base_path":"/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice","content_id":"dcc907d6-433c-42df-9ffb-d9c68be5dc4d","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-07-18T17:26:49Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Ministry of Justice","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"ministry-of-justice","logo":{"formatted_title":"Ministry<br/>of Justice","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}},{"analytics_identifier":"EA73","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service","base_path":"/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service","content_id":"6f757605-ab8f-4b62-84e4-99f79cf085c2","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-02-21T14:12:20Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"HM Courts & Tribunals Service","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"ministry-of-justice","logo":{"formatted_title":"HM Courts &amp; <br/>Tribunals Service","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}},{"analytics_identifier":"PB1142","api_path":"/api/content/courts-tribunals/upper-tribunal-administrative-appeals-chamber","base_path":"/courts-tribunals/upper-tribunal-administrative-appeals-chamber","content_id":"4c2e325a-2d95-442b-856a-e7fb9f9e3cf8","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-06-18T16:08:53Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber)","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":null,"logo":{"formatted_title":"Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber)"}},"links":{}}],"finder":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions","base_path":"/administrative-appeals-tribunal-decisions","content_id":"e9e7fcff-bb0d-4723-af25-9f78d730f6f8","description":"Find decisions on appeals to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber), including social security and child support appeals.","document_type":"finder","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-03-30T10:34:00Z","schema_name":"finder","title":"Administrative appeals tribunal decisions","withdrawn":false,"details":{"document_noun":"decision","filter":{"document_type":"utaac_decision"},"format_name":"Administrative appeals tribunal decision","show_summaries":true,"summary":"<p>Find decisions on appeals to the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber), including social security and child support appeals.</p><p>This includes decisions made from January 2016 onwards.
