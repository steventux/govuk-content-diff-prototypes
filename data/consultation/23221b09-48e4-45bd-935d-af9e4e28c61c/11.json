We invited the public and interested stakeholders to give their views on 3 specific areas:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>assisted digital facilities</li>\n  <li>automatic online conviction and statutory standard penalty</li>\n  <li>panel composition in tribunals.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We received a total of 790 responses to the consultation, including from legal practitioners and their representative groups, charities and other third parties, the judiciary and members of the public. We have carefully considered all the responses, and are now publishing our formal response.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of the consultation, we will be continuing with our proposals to provide assisted digital facilities for users who have trouble with using technology.</p>\n\n<p>We also intend to introduce an automatic online conviction and statutory standard penalty procedure for railway fare evasion, tram fare evasion and possession of unlicensed rod and line.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst we will be removing the requirement for the Senior President of Tribunals (SPT) to pay regard to historic tribunal composition, we do not intend to proceed with the proposal to introduce a single member panel as the default position in the unified tribunals. Instead, we will amend the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal (Composition of Tribunal) Order 2008 that the SPT may provide that a panel should consist of 1, 2 or 3 members, as required, to determine the matters before the tribunal justly and fairly.</p>\n</div>","final_outcome_documents":["<section class=\"attachment embedded\" id=\"attachment_1950057\">\n  <div class=\"attachment-thumb\">\n      <a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/590391/transforming-our-justice-system-government-response.pdf\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/590391/thumbnail_transforming-our-justice-system-government-response.pdf.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"attachment-details\">\n    <h2 class=\"title\"><a href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/590391/transforming-our-justice-system-government-response.pdf\">Transforming our justice system: assisted digital strategy, automatic online conviction and statutory standard penalty, and panel composition in tribunals - government response</a></h2>\n    <p class=\"metadata\">\n        <span class=\"references\">\n          Ref: <span class=\"command_paper_number\">Cm9391</span>\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"type\"><abbr title=\"Portable Document Format\">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class=\"file-size\">388KB</span>, <span class=\"page-length\">36 pages</span>\n    </p>\n\n\n  </div>\n</section>","<section class=\"attachment embedded\" id=\"attachment_1950099\">\n  <div class=\"attachment-thumb\">\n      <a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/590398/transforming-our-justice-system-government-response-cym.pdf\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/590398/thumbnail_transforming-our-justice-system-government-response-cym.pdf.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"attachment-details\">\n    <h2 class=\"title\"><a href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/590398/transforming-our-justice-system-government-response-cym.pdf\">Gweddnewid ein system gyfiawnder: Strategaeth ddigidol â chymorth, euogfarnau ar-lein awtomatig, a chyfansoddiad paneli yn y tribiwnlysoedd - Ymateb y Llywodraeth</a></h2>\n    <p class=\"metadata\">\n        <span class=\"references\">\n          Ref: <span class=\"command_paper_number\">CM9391</span>\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"type\"><abbr title=\"Portable Document Format\">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class=\"file-size\">541KB</span>, <span class=\"page-length\">38 pages</span>\n    </p>\n\n\n  </div>\n</section>"],"first_public_at":"2016-09-15T10:00:00.000+01:00","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","current":true},"tags":{"browse_pages":[],"policies":[],"topics":[]}},"routes":[{"path":"/government/consultations/transforming-our-courts-and-tribunals","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"consultation_outcome","schema_name":"consultation","first_published_at":"2016-09-15T10:23:19Z","base_path":"/government/consultations/transforming-our-courts-and-tribunals","description":"Seeks views on changes to the justice system.","content_id":"23221b09-48e4-45bd-935d-af9e4e28c61c","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"D18","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice","base_path":"/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice","content_id":"dcc907d6-433c-42df-9ffb-d9c68be5dc4d","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-07-18T17:26:49Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Ministry of Justice","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"ministry-of-justice","logo":{"formatted_title":"Ministry<br/>of Justice","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}},{"analytics_identifier":"EA73","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service","base_path":"/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service","content_id":"6f757605-ab8f-4b62-84e4-99f79cf085c2","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-02-21T14:12:20Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"HM Courts & Tribunals Service","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"ministry-of-justice","logo":{"formatted_title":"HM Courts &amp;
