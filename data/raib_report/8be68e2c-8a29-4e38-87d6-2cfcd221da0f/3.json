The tractor driver and two other people nearby sustained minor injuries and two passengers on the train were injured and taken to hospital, but were discharged later that day.\r\n\r\nThe train involved was operated by Arriva Trains Wales and consisted of two 2-car units. It was travelling at 120 km/h (75 mph) at the time of the collision. The train was running from Birmingham International to Aberystwyth and Pwllheli and there were 140 passengers and two crew members on board.

This system broke down. There were also underlying management factors:\r\n\r\n  * the harvest contractor did not implement an effective safe system of work at the crossing\r\n  * Network Rail’s process for risk assessment of these types of crossing did not adequately deal with periods of intensive use\r\n  * Network Rail’s instructions to users of these crossings did not cover periods of intensive use.\r\n\r\nRAIB has made three recommendations:\r\n\r\n  * main line infrastructure managers should improve the risk assessment process at these crossings to take into account the increased risk during periods of intensive use\r\n  * main line infrastructure managers should define safe and practical methods of working to be adopted at these crossings during periods of intensive use\r\n  * RSSB should update the level crossing risk management toolkit to reflect the changes brought about by the second recommendation.\r\n\r\nRAIB has also noted a learning point from an observation made during the investigation concerning the prolonged closure of an adjacent level crossing on a main road after the accident.\r\n\r\n[InlineAttachment:R062014_140327_Buttington_Hall_V2.pdf] \r\n\r\nResponse to recommendations:\r\n\r\n* RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body\r\n* RAIB may add comment, particularly if we
