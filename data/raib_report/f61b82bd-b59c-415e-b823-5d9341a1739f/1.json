the control centre controller did not intervene to stop the movement of the train or follow the emergency procedure; and the control centre controller was not aware of the exact position of the train.</p>\n\n<p>RAIB has made seven recommendations which include the criteria for the location of point position indicators and the review of their sighting and subsequent improvements; alarm management systems in the system management centre; the replacement of all point position indicators with ones that are more conspicuous when lit; and adequate control of changes to the design and operations of the railway.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/media/547c9004e5274a42900001a1/R032010_100304_West_India_Quay.pdf\">R032010-100304-West-India-Quay.pdf</a> </p>\n\n<p>Response to recommendations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>RAIB will periodically update the status of recommendations as reported to us by the relevant safety authority or public body.</li>\n  <li>RAIB may add comment, particularly if we have concerns regarding these responses.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/media/56795ff2e5274a138800000b/03_2010_West_India_Quay.pdf\">RAIB Recommendation response for West India Quay</a></p>\n"},"routes":[{"path":"/raib-reports/derailment-of-a-docklands-light-railway-train-near-west-india-quay-station","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"specialist-publisher","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"raib_report","schema_name":"specialist_document","first_published_at":"2016-02-29T09:24:10Z","base_path":"/raib-reports/derailment-of-a-docklands-light-railway-train-near-west-india-quay-station","description":"Derailment of a Docklands Light Railway train, near West India Quay station, 10 March 2009.","content_id":"f61b82bd-b59c-415e-b823-5d9341a1739f","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"OT249","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/rail-accident-investigation-branch","base_path":"/government/organisations/rail-accident-investigation-branch","content_id":"013872d8-8bbb-4e80-9b79-45c7c5cf9177","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-04-01T09:33:41Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Rail Accident Investigation Branch","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"department-for-transport","logo":{"formatted_title":"Rail Accident<br/>Investigation Branch","image":{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/organisation/logo/249/GOVUKlogo.jpg","alt_text":"Rail Accident Investigation Branch"}}},"links":{}}],"finder":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/raib-reports","base_path":"/raib-reports","content_id":"e3ff7fc5-6788-45de-83f0-cbf34e9fe8bd","description":"Find reports of RAIB investigations into rail accidents and incidents","document_type":"finder","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-03-30T10:34:00Z","schema_name":"finder","title":"Rail Accident Investigation Branch reports","withdrawn":false,"details":{"document_noun":"report","filter":{"document_type":"raib_report"},"format_name":"Rail Accident Investigation Branch report","show_summaries":false,"facets":[{"key":"railway_type","name":"Railway type","type":"text","preposition":"of type","display_as_result_metadata":true,"filterable":true,"allowed_values":[{"label":"Heavy rail","value":"heavy-rail"},{"label":"Light rail","value":"light-rail"},{"label":"Metros","value":"metros"},{"label":"Heritage railways","value":"heritage-railways"}]},{"key":"report_type","name":"Report type","type":"text","preposition":"of type","display_as_result_metadata":true,"filterable":true,"allowed_values":[{"label":"Investigation report","value":"investigation-report"},{"label":"Bulletin","value":"bulletin"},{"label":"Interim report","value":"interim-report"},{"label":"Discontinuation report","value":"discontinuation-report"},{"label":"Safety digest","value":"safety-digest"}]},{"key":"date_of_occurrence","name":"Date of occurrence","short_name":"Occurred","type":"date","preposition":"occurred","display_as_result_metadata":true,"filterable":true}],"default_documents_per_page":50},"links":{}}],"available_translations":[{"title":"Derailment near West India Quay station","public_updated_at":"2014-12-10T10:20:23Z","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"raib_report","schema_name":"specialist_document","base_path":"/raib-reports/derailment-of-a-docklands-light-railway-train-near-west-india-quay-station","description":"Derailment of a Docklands Light Railway train, near West India Quay station, 10 March 2009.","api_path":"/api/content/raib-reports/derailment-of-a-docklands-light-railway-train-near-west-india-quay-station","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"f61b82bd-b59c-415e-b823-5d9341a1739f","locale":"en"}]},"format":"specialist_document","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"other","government_document_supertype":"other","payload_version":0}
