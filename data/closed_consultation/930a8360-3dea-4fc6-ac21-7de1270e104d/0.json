{"title":"Temporary Seizure and Retention of Travel Documents consultation","public_updated_at":"2014-12-16T10:30:00Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>The government introduced the Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill on Wednesday 26 November 2014. The bill is a direct response to the increased terrorist threat. It will ensure that we can: disrupt the ability of people to travel abroad to fight and their ability to return here, enhance our ability to monitor and control the actions of those in the UK who pose a threat, and combat the underlying ideology that supports terrorism. The bill will include a power for the police to seize temporarily the passports and travel documents of individuals suspected of intending to travel to engage in terrorism-related activity outside the UK and retain these documents for up to 30 days. The new measure will be a significant addition to the powers that currently exist to disrupt terrorism-related travel.</p>\n\n<p>This consultation seeks responses to a draft code of practice on the proposed powers under Schedule 1 of the Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill to temporarily seize and retain passports and travel documents at a port when there is reasonable suspicion that the person is travelling outside the United Kingdom for the purpose of involvement in terrorism-related activity. The responses to this consultation will inform the development of the code of practice and guard against any risk of improper use.</p>\n\n<p>How to Respond</p>\n\n<p>Please send us your comments using the online survey. You should read the PDF copy of the consultation questions first before beginning the online version. The deadline for response is 26 January 2015.</p>\n\n<p>If you are not able to respond using the online survey, you can email your response to: TPSconsultationresponses@homeoffice.x.gsi.gov.uk</p>\n\n<p>Or write to:</p>\n\n<p>Temporary Seizure of Travel Documents Consultation\nHome Office\n(NSD) Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism\n5th Floor Peel Building\n2 Marsham Street\nLondon.\nSW1P 4DF</p>\n\n<p>We will take account of the evidence gathered during this consultation in developing the code of practice.
