Currently, the 2 schemes are treated differently by local authorities when making a financial assessment to determine what a person can afford to contribute to the costs of their care and support.</p>\n\n<p>In the 2016 Budget, the government announced that a change would be made to the care and support charging arrangements in England to treat the schemes more consistently. This will be done by requiring regular payments made to veterans under the War Pensions Scheme to be disregarded (i.e. not taken into account) when local authorities conduct the financial assessment. This will come at a cost to local authorities through reduced income from charging.</p>\n\n<p>This consultation seeks local authorities’ views on the formula by which the £14 million funding to cover these costs in 2017 to 2018 should be allocated to individual local authorities.</p>\n</div>","closing_date":"2016-11-21T23:45:00.000+00:00","emphasised_organisations":["7cd6bf12-bbe9-4118-8523-f927b0442156"],"opening_date":"2016-11-04T15:00:00.000+00:00","change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2017-02-27T12:25:24.000+00:00","note":"Added consultation response."},{"public_timestamp":"2016-11-04T15:00:00.000+00:00","note":"First published."}],"documents":["<section class=\"attachment embedded\" id=\"attachment_1977166\">\n  <div class=\"attachment-thumb\">\n      <a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/565674/war_pensions.pdf\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/565674/thumbnail_war_pensions.pdf.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"attachment-details\">\n    <h2 class=\"title\"><a href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/565674/war_pensions.pdf\">Consultation on allocating 2017-18 funding to disregard war pensions in social care financial assessments</a></h2>\n    <p class=\"metadata\">\n        <span class=\"type\"><abbr title=\"Portable Document Format\">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class=\"file-size\">477KB</span>, <span class=\"page-length\">21 pages</span>\n    </p>\n\n\n  </div>\n</section>"],"final_outcome_detail":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>This consultation response sets out how £14 million funding should be allocated to individual local authorities in 2017 to 2018.
