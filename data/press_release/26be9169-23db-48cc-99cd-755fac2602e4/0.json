Slip roads will be kept open throughout.</p>\n\n<p>Highways England delivery manager, Colin Jackson, said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We will be starting work on a major concrete repair and waterproofing scheme at the Oldbury viaduct, between junctions 1 and 2 of the M5 in the West Midlands, this month.</p>\n\n  <p>At a cost in excess of £100 million Highways England is delivering a huge investment that will support economic growth locally and in the wider West Midlands.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Motorists travelling from across the country will be encouraged to consider alternative routes such as the M42 and M6 to keep congestion to a minimum on the M5 and surrounding roads while work takes place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Highways England is keeping the haulage, freight and distribution industries informed of the essential work, expected to last until Spring 2019, to allow their lorry drivers to plan ahead and seek alternative routes.</p>\n\n<p>People are also being asked to consider car sharing or use alternative methods of transport where possible.\nHighways England will continue working with businesses and hauliers as well as local authority partners and other organisations as the scheme gets under way.</p>\n\n<p>For more information <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.highways.gov.uk/oldburyviaduct\">visit the scheme
