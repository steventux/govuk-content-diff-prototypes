The Fish Health Inspectorate (<abbr title=\"Fish Health Inspectorate\">FHI</abbr>) at Cefas, acting on behalf of Defra has issued a confirmed designation prohibiting the movement of fish to, from and within the fishery complex.</p>\n\n<p>Fishery equipment disinfection and movement control measures are in place and anglers must ensure that they comply with all biosecurity measures within the designated area.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/report-serious-fish-or-shellfish-diseases\">KHV</a> has no implications for human health. It is nonetheless, a serious viral disease of fish, and is notifiable in the United Kingdom. KHV affects all varieties of common and ornamental carp (Cyprinus carpio) and can result in high rates of fish mortalities.</p>\n\n<p>Clinical signs of KHV disease may include white or necrotic patches on the gills, rough patches on the skin, sloughing mucous and sunken eyes. These signs usually appear when water temperatures are between 16 and 28 degrees centigrade. Anyone noting deaths in carp or carp hybrids, with signs of disease similar to those above, or have suspicion of notifiable disease in any aquatic animal, should immediately contact the <abbr title=\"Fish Health Inspectorate\">FHI</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone who imports, keeps, fishes for, or retails carp (common and ornamental) and carp hybrids should take precautions to prevent the spread of KHV.</p>\n\n<div class=\"contact \" id=\"contact_1510\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>Fish Health Inspectorate</h3>\n\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n\n        <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n            <p class=\"email\">\n              <span class=\"type\">Email</span>\n              <a class=\"email\" href=\"mailto:%20fhi@cefas.co.uk\"> fhi@cefas.co.uk</a>\n            </p>\n            <p class=\"tel\">\n              <span class=\"type\">Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm</span>\n              01305 206700\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"additional-notes\">Additional notes</h2>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://cefas.defra.gov.uk\">Cefas</a> is an executive agency of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs\">Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</a> (Defra).
