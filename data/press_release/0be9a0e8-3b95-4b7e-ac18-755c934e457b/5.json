{"title":"Improved road surface for drivers on the A66 in North Yorkshire","public_updated_at":"2016-06-24T14:25:56Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>Contractors for Highways England will be resurfacing around 3.5 miles of the A66 between the B6274 at Hartforth and where the A66 joins the A1 at Scotch Corner.</p>\n\n<p>The work will be carried out in two phases. The first phase will start on Monday 27 June until Friday 8 July and will mean a full closure of the eastbound carriageway between the junction with Moor Road at Melsonby and Scotch Corner. There will also be lane closures on the A1 southbound exit slip road at Scotch Corner and on the roundabout.</p>\n\n<p>The work will be carried out under a 24 hours a day contraflow system, which means traffic will be able to travel in both directions on the westbound carriageway so drivers can continue their journeys safely.</p>\n\n<p>Phase 2 will be carried out overnight with temporary traffic lights in place and traffic being led through the closures by a contractorâ€™s vehicle in convoys. The project is due to be completed on Friday 22 July.</p>\n\n<p>Highways England Project Manager Chris Corcoran said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When complete, this project will provide drivers with safer and smoother journeys along this stretch of the A66.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">We have decided to split the work into 2 phases to reduce the amount of time junctions are closed or access is restricted to keep disruption to local residents and drivers to a minimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Clearly signed diversions will be in place during the full closures.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"general-enquiries\">General enquiries</h3>\n\n<p>Members of the public should contact the Highways England customer contact centre on 0300 123 5000.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"media-enquiries\">Media enquiries</h3>\n\n<p>Journalists should contact the Highways England press office on 0844 693 1448 and use the menu to speak to the most appropriate press officer.</p>\n</div>","emphasised_organisations":["ddad017a-eb20-41d9-8386-56293be68aab"],"change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2016-06-24T15:25:56.000+01:00","note":"First published."}],"image":{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/default_news_organisation_image_data/file/176/s300_M42_dusk_940x600.jpg","caption":null,"alt_text":"placeholder"},"first_public_at":"2016-06-24T15:25:56.000+01:00","political":false,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","current":true},"tags":{"browse_pages":[],"policies":["road-network-and-traffic"],"topics":[]}},"routes":[{"path":"/government/news/improved-road-surface-for-drivers-on-the-a66-in-north-yorkshire","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"press_release","schema_name":"news_article","first_published_at":"2016-06-24T14:25:56Z","base_path":"/government/news/improved-road-surface-for-drivers-on-the-a66-in-north-yorkshire","description":"Drivers will benefit from an improved road surface once work to resurface the A66 in North Yorkshire is complete.
