As we progress there will be further consultation and opportunities to be part of shaping the detail for the area, now and for future generations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Dartford Crossing image 2\" src=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/63229/image_003.jpg\"></div>\n  <figcaption>The Dartford Crossing is already over capacity – the new Lower Thames Crossing will relieve this.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>The scheme will cost £4.4 billion and the new 70mph, 13 mile route and crossing will improve journeys for drivers. Capacity for vehicles crossing the Thames east of London will increase by 70 per cent.</p>\n\n<p>Around 55 million journeys are made each year on the Dartford Crossing, six million more than it was designed for, and it suffers from closures due to incidents almost daily. This announcement provides a huge boost for local businesses, of which many agree that the new crossing will help their business to grow and employ more people.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"image
