It can be used on a whole parcel or a part parcel.</p>\n\n<p>The applicant must also meet at least one of the following conditions to use this option: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>following a recommended fertiliser management system to plan nutrient inputs across the farm</li>\n  <li>adopt a recommended fertiliser management system within 18 months of the start of the agreement</li>\n  <li>qualifies as a low intensity farmer</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"when-the-option-cant-be-used\">When the option can’t be used</h3>\n\n<p>It can’t be used on: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>parcels at risk of soil erosion or runoff</li>\n  <li>organic parcels</li>\n  <li>land in conversion</li>\n  <li>on parcels with historic or archaeological features</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-apply\">How to apply</h2>\n\n<p>Applicants can read the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countryside-stewardship\">Countryside Stewardship guidance</a> for more on eligibility and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/countryside-stewardship/how-to-apply\">how to apply</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-this-option-will-benefit-the-environment\">How this option will benefit the environment</h2>\n\n<p>This option will produce a vigorous sward with abundant legumes and herbs suitable for productive cattle and sheep. It will also provide habitat and food for invertebrates, including crop pollinators, and improve soil structure and water infiltration. </p>\n\n<p>This option doesn’t use nitrogen fertilisers, which contribute to climate change. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"requirements\">Requirements</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"higher-tier-agreements\">Higher Tier agreements</h3>\n\n<p>The requirements may differ slightly for a Higher Tier agreement as the option will be tailored to the site. Applicants should discuss and agree these requirements with their adviser.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"applications\">Applications</h3>\n\n<p>If applicants intend to use this option on permanent grassland, they will need to provide evidence with the application that it has been cultivated within the last 5 years. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"on-the-land\">On the land</h3>\n\n<p>Successful applicants will need to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>establish a mixed sward of grasses, legumes and herbs or wildflowers in the first 12 months of the agreement </li>\n  <li>maintain the required area of mixed sward for the remainder of the agreement</li>\n  <li>make sure the sward has a minimum 10% cover of red clover</li>\n  <li>make sure the sward has an additional 10% cover of other legumes, herbs and wildflowers (white clover, creeping buttercup and injurious weeds don’t count as cover)</li>\n  <li>make sure that the sward contains at least 5 species of grass, 3 species of legume (including bird’s-foot trefoil) and 5 species of herb or wildflower</li>\n  <li>re-establish the sward if necessary, on the same or a different field, to maintain these minimum requirements </li>\n  <li>manage the sward by cutting or grazing</li>\n  <li>leave the sward to rest for at least 5 weeks between 1 May and 31 July, so that the majority of red clover flowers are open and available for pollinators</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is a rotational option, so it may be moved between different eligible parcels of land. However, the same total area (hectarage) must be maintained each year.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"keeping-records\">Keeping records</h3>\n\n<p>Successful applicants will need to keep the following records and supply them on request:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>field operations at the parcel level, including associated invoices</li>\n  <li>stock records to show grazing activity on parcels</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-must-not-be-done\">What must not be done</h2>\n\n<p>Do not use: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>any pesticides (except herbicides to spot treat or weed-wipe injurious weeds or invasive non-native species)</li>\n  <li>inorganic fertilisers containing nitrogen</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-carry-out-this-option\">How to carry out this option</h2>\n\n<p>The following section gives advice on carrying out this option successfully but does not form part of the requirements for this option.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-choose-a-site\">How to choose a site</h3>\n\n<p>The option allows only very limited use of pesticides so only fields that don’t have a burden of weeds or slugs should be chosen. Clovers, in particular, grow less well in soil that has a pH less than 6.0 and that is below index 2 for phosphorus and potassium. Soil can be improved with lime, manures or PK (but not N) fertiliser.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-to-establish-the-site\">How to establish the site</h3>\n\n<p>Sow shallowly on to a firm, clean, fine seedbed. Alternatively, sow into an established grass sward. Create at least 50% bare ground (and preferably 70%) and pay careful attention to slugs and other pests. Sowing legumes and herbs after August may not allow good enough establishment before the winter. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"legumes\">Legumes</h3>\n\n<p>Most of the widely available, inexpensive cultivars of red clover have low persistence, so the sward is likely to need to be re-established in its third year.</p>\n\n<p>Also be aware that white and red clover can cause bloat, particularly in cattle.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"herbs\">Herbs</h3>\n\n<p>Chicory is a highly productive species, eaten by cattle and sheep, that can protect against internal parasites. It’s better suited to grazing than cutting, as it produces a stout stem that’s difficult to dry and that can damage the wrapping of big bales.</p>\n","headers":[{"text":"How much will be paid","level":2,"id":"how-much-will-be-paid"},{"text":"Where the option is available","level":2,"id":"where-the-option-is-available","headers":[{"text":"When the option can’t be used","level":3,"id":"when-the-option-cant-be-used"}]},{"text":"How to apply","level":2,"id":"how-to-apply"},{"text":"How this option will benefit the environment","level":2,"id":"how-this-option-will-benefit-the-environment"},{"text":"Requirements","level":2,"id":"requirements","headers":[{"text":"Higher Tier agreements","level":3,"id":"higher-tier-agreements"},{"text":"Applications","level":3,"id":"applications"},{"text":"On the land","level":3,"id":"on-the-land"},{"text":"Keeping records","level":3,"id":"keeping-records"}]},{"text":"What must not be done","level":2,"id":"what-must-not-be-done"},{"text":"How to carry out this option","level":2,"id":"how-to-carry-out-this-option","headers":[{"text":"How to choose a site","level":3,"id":"how-to-choose-a-site"},{"text":"How to establish the site","level":3,"id":"how-to-establish-the-site"},{"text":"Legumes","level":3,"id":"legumes"},{"text":"Herbs","level":3,"id":"herbs"}]}]},"routes":[{"path":"/countryside-stewardship-grants/legume-and-herb-rich-swards-gs4","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"specialist-publisher","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"countryside_stewardship_grant","schema_name":"specialist_document","first_published_at":"2016-02-29T09:24:10Z","base_path":"/countryside-stewardship-grants/legume-and-herb-rich-swards-gs4","description":"Find out about eligibility and requirements for the legume and herb-rich swards option.","content_id":"62d8ba1d-2e1f-4140-9c12-2683f7e3c85c","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"PB202","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/natural-england","base_path":"/government/organisations/natural-england","content_id":"d3ce4ba7-bc75-46b4-89d9-38cb3240376d","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-07-04T15:28:12Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Natural England","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs","logo":{"formatted_title":"Natural England","image":{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/organisation/logo/202/NatEng_logo_New-Green.png","alt_text":"Natural England"}}},"links":{}}],"finder":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/countryside-stewardship-grants","base_path":"/countryside-stewardship-grants","content_id":"0eb7b150-879a-4c44-becc-718e23a77e2c","description":"Find information about Countryside Stewardship options, capital items and supplements","document_type":"finder","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-03-30T10:34:00Z","schema_name":"finder","title":"Countryside Stewardship grants","withdrawn":false,"details":{"document_noun":"grant","filter":{"document_type":"countryside_stewardship_grant"},"format_name":"Countryside Stewardship grant","show_summaries":false,"summary":"<p>Find options, supplements and capital items to include in your application for Countryside Stewardship.
