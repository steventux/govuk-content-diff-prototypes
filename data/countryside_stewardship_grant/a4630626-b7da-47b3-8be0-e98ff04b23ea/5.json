Using chemicals should be a last resort, as they can damage root fungi in the soil. Trees depend on fungi for future good health.\r\n\r\n###Controlling livestock damage\r\n\r\nTo prevent livestock damage:\r\n\r\n* provide alternative shelter with water to attract animals away from trees\r\n* fence off trees to stop animals rubbing and stripping bark or trampling the base\r\n\r\nIf fences are used they should be placed at the edge of the option area.\r\n\r\n##Further information\r\n\r\nSee the [Mid Tier manual](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/countryside-stewardship-mid-tier-including-water-quality-capital-items-manual) or [Higher Tier manual](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/countryside-stewardship-higher-tier-manual) to find out more about the scheme and how to apply.\r\n"},{"content_type":"text/html","content":"<h2 id=\"how-much-will-be-paid\">How much will be paid</h2>\n\n<p>£190 per hectare (ha).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"where-to-use-this-option\">Where to use this option</h2>\n\n<p>Available for Mid Tier and Higher Tier</p>\n\n<p>Part parcel</p>\n\n<p>Only on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>grassland receiving more than 100kg per ha of nitrogen a year in fertilisers or manures</li>\n  <li>trees (dead or alive) at least 30cm diameter at breast height (dbh)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"where-this-option-cannot-be-used\">Where this option cannot be used</h2>\n\n<p>On a group or line of 4 or more trees whose canopies overlap.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-this-option-will-benefit-the-environment\">How this option will benefit the environment</h2>\n\n<p>If successful, trees will be protected from agricultural operations and kept as important features in the local landscape.
