{"title":"HS7: Management of historic water meadows through traditional irrigation","public_updated_at":"2017-03-10T10:36:22Z","details":{"body":[{"content_type":"text/govspeak","content":"##How much will be paid\r\n\r\n£440 per hectare (ha).\r\n\r\n##Where to use this option \r\n\r\nAvailable for Higher Tier\r\n\r\nOnly:\r\n\r\n* on functioning water meadows that are managed using traditional practices, ie where irrigation is achieved through a system of inlet and outlet channels\r\n* where management has written support from the Environment Agency\r\n\r\n##Where this option cannot be used\r\n\r\nOn meadows:\r\n\r\n* that flood naturally and do not have control structures such as sluices and hatches to regulate water levels\r\n* where water cannot be controlled - water needs to flow evenly across the meadow at up to 25mm in depth when drowned\r\n\r\n##How this option will benefit the environment\r\n\r\nIt protects heritage by conserving historic water meadow systems and keeping them in a stable condition.\r\n\r\nIt maintains the demanding traditional management needed on both ‘bedwork’ and ‘catch’ water meadows. It also maintains habitat and water quality. \r\n\r\nIf successful there will be:\r\n\r\n* a well-managed grass sward with no scrub developing\r\n* a working water meadow system with structurally sound water control features\r\n* maintenance carried out using traditional materials and methods\r\n\r\nIt will also help conserve the character of the farm and traditional land-use patterns.\r\n\r\n##Requirements\r\n\r\nAgreement holders will usually need to:\r\n\r\n* float or drown the meadow for an agreed period of time each year\r\n* maintain the gutters, carriers or channels to encourage an even film of water approximately 25mm deep to flow over the sward\r\n* maintain and repair the water control structures such as sluices, weirs and hatches, keeping a record of the work\r\n* manage the meadow by grazing or hay cutting once the land has dried out \r\n* use very little or no manures, fertilisers, pesticides or supplementary feed \r\n* control undesirable plants\r\n\r\nThe agreement will set out what must not be done. It is likely agreement holders will not be allowed to:\r\n\r\n* harrow or roll\r\n* work on the gutters, carriers or channels during late spring and summer\r\n* plough, cultivate or re-seed\r\n* remove, replace or relocate historic structures\r\n\r\n###Keeping records\r\n\r\nAgreement holders will need to keep the following records and supply them on request:\r\n\r\n* a [structures maintenance record](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/countryside-stewardship-hs6-and-hs7-structural-maintenance-plan-and-record-forms) using the template and: \r\n  * at least once a year, carry out and record the results of an inspection of the water body and associated features\r\n  * complete the record with a list of items needing attention and a record of repair and maintenance work that has been carried out\r\n  * photographs - before and after shots of all maintenance works and minor repairs that have been carried out to be submitted with the final claim\r\n  * stock grazing records\r\n  * any bank statements, receipted invoices, consents or permissions connected with the work\r\n  * records of all management activity on the option area for each parcel\r\n\r\nOn your annual claim you will be asked to declare that you haven't carried out any activities prohibited by the option requirements.\r\n\r\nFor the final claim, agreement holders will need to submit photographs of the current state of the water meadow and its structural, historic and archaeological features.\r\n\r\nApplicants will need to send the following with their application:\r\n\r\n* photographs of the current state of the water meadow and its structural, historic and archaeological features \r\n* a copy of the Environment Agency written approval and any necessary consents\r\n* a map of existing tracks and routes\r\n\r\nThe detailed requirements for this option will be tailored to the Higher Tier site.
