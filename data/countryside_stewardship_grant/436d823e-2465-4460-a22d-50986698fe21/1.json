Pollution from sheep dips can cause damage to people and aquatic wildlife. Relocating sheep pens can help reduce risk of diffuse water pollution. \r\n\r\n##Requirements\r\n\r\n* new sheep holding pens must be installed at least:\r\n\r\n  * 10m from watercourses (including streams, ditches, land drains and wetlands)\r\n  * 30m from watercourses that drain into protected conservation sites (such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs))\r\n  * 50m from any spring, well or borehole\r\n\r\n* install new pens and comply with the [Groundwater Protection Code](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sheep-dip-groundwater-protection-code)\r\n* meet relevant [British Standards](http://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/standards/british-standards-online-database/) - examine copies of the most up-to-date standards for guidance\r\n \r\nDo not: \r\n\r\n* install the pens (or any dip baths) on a slope, or at the top of one, where there is a risk that spillage might drain to a watercourse, road or track\r\n \r\n###Keeping records\r\n\r\nAgreement holders will need to keep the following records and supply them on request:\r\n\r\n* any consents or permissions connected with the work\r\n* receipted invoices or bank statements where a receipted invoice is unavailable\r\n* please see the record keeping and inspection requirements as set out in the [Mid Tier manual](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/countryside-stewardship-mid-tier-including-water-quality-capital-items-manual) for more detail\r\n\r\nAgreement holders will need to keep the following records and supply them with the claim:\r\n\r\n* photographs of the completed work\r\n\r\nBefore applying, applicants must seek advice from the EA and Local Planning Authority to check if consent is required to carry out the planned work.\r\n \r\nApplicants will have to send the following with their application:\r\n\r\n* a copy of any advice, permit or consent received from the EA or Local Planning Authority\r\n* photographs of the existing site and current dipping facilities\r\n* written support from a CSF officer\r\n\r\n##Related Mid Tier items\r\n\r\nThis item can be used on the same area as the following items:\r\n\r\n* [RP20 - Relocation of sheep dips and pens](https://www.gov.uk/countryside-stewardship-grants/relocation-of-sheep-dips-and-pens-rp20)\r\n* [RP22 - Sheep dip drainage aprons and sumps](https://www.gov.uk/countryside-stewardship-grants/sheep-dip-drainage-aprons-and-sumps-rp22)\r\n* [RP23 - Installation of livestock drinking troughs (in draining pens for freshly dipped sheep)](https://www.gov.uk/countryside-stewardship-grants/installation-of-livestock-drinking-troughs-in-draining-pens-for-freshly-dipped-sheep-rp23)\r\n\r\n##Advice and suggestions for how to carry out this item\r\n\r\nThe following section gives advice on carrying out this item successfully but does not form part of the requirements for this item.\r\n\r\n###How to get a permit to discharge sheep dip\r\n\r\nAgreement holders will need an [environmental permit](https://www.gov.uk/environmental-permit-check-if-you-need-one) to discharge sheep dip to land. A variation to an existing permit may also be required if the location of the discharge area has changed. \r\n\r\n###How to construct the drain pens \r\n\r\nThe most effective drain pens should:\r\n\r\n* be large enough to hold sheep for at least 10 minutes after dipping\r\n* have properly sealed floors and built-in slopes (allowing excess dip to drain back to the bath, rather than soaking into the ground, the soil or a surface water drain) \r\n* have concrete areas that are impermeable, with watertight sealed joints\r\n* have a filter or trap to prevent dirt and dip draining back into the bath\r\n\r\n###How to protect the historic environment\r\n\r\nThis item should not be used: \r\n\r\n* close to a historic farmstead or listed building (get advice on listed building consent)\r\n* on sites of archaeological or historic importance as identified in the HEFER (get advice on Scheduled Monument consent from Historic England, before using this item on such sites)\r\n\r\nAgreement holders should also consider the character of the landscape when constructing new fencing lines. This particularly applies in designated landscapes or historic parkland.\r\n\r\nAgreement holders must consult Natural England if intending to install the dip on an SSSI. \r\n\r\n##Further information\r\n\r\nFollow this guidance when [designing dip baths](http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/adlib/defra/content.aspx?doc=11356&id=11365). \r\n\r\nCatchment Sensitive Farming (CSF) operates in parts of the country where there are water quality issues linked to farming.
