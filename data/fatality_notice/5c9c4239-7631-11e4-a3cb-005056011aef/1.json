He had served in Sierra Leone and Afghanistan. He was engaged to Miss Rebecca Williams and his younger brother is serving in the same unit.</p>\n\n<p>His father, Gordon Evans, gave the following statement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">On behalf of my whole family, I wish to say that we are all devastated by the loss of our son Llywelyn Karl Evans. Whilst we are deeply saddened, we are, and always will be proud of him. We would like to thank all of the family, friends and local people for their flowers and messages of support. This has given us great strength.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Major John Francis is Families Officer with 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery at its Plymouth base. He said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">The loss of three fine members is acutely felt by us all. That they served with the same Battery only heightens the sense of grief. Together with the deaths of our two Army personnel, Sergeant Hehir and Lance Bombardier Evans, we mourn also for Ian Seymour, a naval rating who had been with 29 Commando since 1999 and was very much a part of Regiment life. Our thoughts remain very much with their families at this time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The media are asked to respect the family’s privacy.</p>\n</div>","first_public_at":"2012-12-11T13:04:43.000+00:00","change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2003-03-23T01:00:00.000+00:00","note":"First published."}],"emphasised_organisations":["d994e55c-48c9-4795-b872-58d8ec98af12"]},"routes":[{"path":"/government/fatalities/lance-bombardier-llywelyn-evans","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"fatality_notice","schema_name":"fatality_notice","first_published_at":null,"base_path":"/government/fatalities/lance-bombardier-llywelyn-evans","description":"It is with deep regret that the Ministry of Defence confirms the death of Lance Bombardier Llywelyn Karl Evans, 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery on 21 March 2003.
