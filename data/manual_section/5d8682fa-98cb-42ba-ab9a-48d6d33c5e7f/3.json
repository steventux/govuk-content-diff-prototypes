The section confirms the provisions of ss.2, 3 and 5 that if an invention in an application in suit is entitled for priority to the filing date of an earlier application specified in a declaration of priority under s.5(2) then any disclosure or use of matter contained in that earlier application on or after the filing date of the earlier application cannot invalidate a claim to that invention.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ref6-02\">6.02</h3>\n<p>In Beloit Technologies Inc v Valmet Paper Machinery Inc [1995] RPC 705 Jacob J held that s.6(1) does not carve out from the state of the art matter made available to the public in the priority interval just because that matter is in the priority document. Thus, an invention which is not entitled to the priority date of an earlier  application can be invalidated by the disclosure or use, between the filing dates of the earlier application and the application in suit, of matter contained in the earlier application.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"section-1\">6.03</h3>\n<p>In his judgment in Beloit Technologies Jacob J reached the same general conclusions as the Enlarged Board of Appeal (G3/93 OJEPO 1-2/1995) which considered the implications of a document published during the priority period, the technical content of which corresponds to that of the  priority document, and concluded that the  published document constitutes prior art citable against the application claiming priority from the priority document to the extent that such priority is not validly claimed. This also applies if a claim to priority is invalid due to the fact that the priority document and the subsequent application do not concern the same invention because the application claims subject matter not disclosed in the priority document.</p>\n","manual":{"base_path":"/guidance/manual-of-patent-practice-mopp"},"organisations":[{"title":"Intellectual Property Office","abbreviation":"IPO","web_url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/intellectual-property-office"}]},"routes":[{"path":"/guidance/manual-of-patent-practice-mopp/section-6-disclosure-of-matter-etc-between-earlier-and-later-applications","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"manuals-publisher","rendering_app":"manuals-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"manual_section","schema_name":"manual_section","first_published_at":"2016-02-29T09:24:10Z","base_path":"/guidance/manual-of-patent-practice-mopp/section-6-disclosure-of-matter-etc-between-earlier-and-later-applications","description":"Sections (6.01 - 6.03) last updated April 2007.","content_id":"5d8682fa-98cb-42ba-ab9a-48d6d33c5e7f","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"manual":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/guidance/manual-of-patent-practice-mopp","base_path":"/guidance/manual-of-patent-practice-mopp","content_id":"b59056ac-f7e9-4415-96b5-79cc5cfb0a76","description":"The Manual of Patent Practice (MOPP) explains the Intellectual Property Office's practice under the Patents Act 1977.","document_type":"manual","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-03-31T12:40:45Z","schema_name":"manual","title":"Manual of Patent Practice","withdrawn":false,"links":{}}],"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"EA34","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/intellectual-property-office","base_path":"/government/organisations/intellectual-property-office","content_id":"5d6f9583-991f-413d-ae83-be7274e5eae4","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-02-17T11:00:13Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Intellectual Property Office","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"department-for-business-innovation-skills","logo":{"formatted_title":"Intellectual<br/>Property <br/>Office","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}}],"available_translations":[{"title":"Section 6: Disclosure of matter, etc, between earlier and later applications ","public_updated_at":"2016-06-07T13:21:01Z","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"manual_section","schema_name":"manual_section","base_path":"/guidance/manual-of-patent-practice-mopp/section-6-disclosure-of-matter-etc-between-earlier-and-later-applications","description":"Sections (6.01 - 6.03) last updated April 2007.","api_path":"/api/content/guidance/manual-of-patent-practice-mopp/section-6-disclosure-of-matter-etc-between-earlier-and-later-applications","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"5d8682fa-98cb-42ba-ab9a-48d6d33c5e7f","locale":"en"}]},"format":"manual_section","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"other","government_document_supertype":"other","payload_version":0}
