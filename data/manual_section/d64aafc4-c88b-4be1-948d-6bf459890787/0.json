{"title":"Section 2: Key changes","public_updated_at":"2016-01-15T15:28:15Z","details":{"body":"<h2 id=\"key-changes\">2 Key changes</h2>\n<p>The new national curriculum has been taught in all LA maintained primary schools, and some academies, in England since September 2014. Those pupils who are at the end of <abbr title=\"key stage 2\">KS2</abbr> in May 2016 will be the first to be assessed against the new national curriculum.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-tests\">2.1 New tests</h2>\n\n<p>From 2016, <abbr title=\"key stage 2\">KS2</abbr> national curriculum test outcomes will no longer be reported using levels. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/scaled-scores\">Scaled scores</a> will be used instead. </p>\n\n<p>There will only be 1 set of tests for each subject. The tests will include a small number of questions designed to assess the most able pupils so separate tests, such as the previous level 6 tests, are no longer required. </p>\n\n<p>The mental mathematics test has been replaced with an arithmetic test.   </p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"key stage 2\">KS2</abbr> tests consist of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>English reading: reading booklet and associated answer booklet</li>\n  <li>English grammar, punctuation and spelling Paper 1: short answer questions</li>\n  <li>English grammar, punctuation and spelling Paper 2: spelling</li>\n  <li>mathematics Paper 1: arithmetic</li>\n  <li>mathematics Paper 2: reasoning</li>\n  <li>mathematics Paper 3: reasoning</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A full set of sample tests and materials has been published to help teachers prepare for the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum-assessments-2016-sample-materials\">2016 <abbr title=\"key stage 2\">KS2</abbr> national curriculum tests.</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"test-administration-window\">2.2 Test administration window</h2>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"key stage 2\">KS2</abbr> tests will be administered in the week commencing 9 May 2016.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"interim-teacher-assessment-frameworks\">2.3 Interim teacher assessment frameworks</h2>\n\n<p>Following the removal of teacher assessment levels, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-assessment-moderation-requirements-for-key-stage-2\">interim teacher assessment frameworks</a> have been provided to support teachers in making robust and accurate judgements for pupils at the end of <abbr title=\"key stage 2\">KS2</abbr> in 2016. </p>\n\n<p>The interim teacher assessment frameworks for key stage 2 are for 2015 to 2016 only.

Where a pupil does not take all of the tests early, they may now take the other tests in future years. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"science-sampling-tests\">2.7 Science sampling tests</h2>\n\n<p>The biennial science sampling tests will take place in June 2016.
