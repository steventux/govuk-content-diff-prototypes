The provision operates by making the spouse or civil partner concurrently liable with the transferor for the tax due on the chargeable transfer.\r\n\r\n##14.2 Limit of spouse's liability\r\n\r\nThe limit of the tax liability of the transferor's spouse or civil partner is determined by the \"market value\" (as defined in s.140(2)) of the property at the date of transfer to the spouse or civil partner. \r\n\r\n##14.3 Fall in value relief\r\n\r\nS.203(2) provides for a fall in value relief for the spouse's concurrent tax liability where the transferor is owing tax, provided the \"spouse transfer\" preceded the \"chargeable transfer\".\r\n\r\n##14.4 References to DVs\r\n\r\nIn detail, the rules for the operation of s.203 are very complex and can require substantial valuation input from DVs.
