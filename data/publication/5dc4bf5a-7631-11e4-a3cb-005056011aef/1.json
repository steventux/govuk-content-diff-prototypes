{"title":"NHS Referral to Treatment waiting times statistics, May 2010","public_updated_at":"2010-07-15T00:00:00Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>NHS RTT waiting times figures for the month ending May 2010 include data for England, Primary Care Trusts, Strategic Health Authorities, and NHS Trusts.</p>\n\n<p>The key points from the latest release are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Data are published on consultant-led Referral to Treatment (RTT) waiting times for patients who were treated during May 2010. In total, 292,000 admitted patients and 859,000 non-admitted patients, for whom English commissioners are responsible, completed their RTT pathway during May 2010.</li>\n  <li>The average (median) time waited for patients completing an RTT pathway in May 2010 was 8.4 weeks for admitted patients and 4.3 weeks for non-admitted patients.</li>\n  <li>The 95th percentile time waited for patients completing an RTT pathway in May 2010 was 21.2 weeks for admitted patients and 14.6 weeks for non-admitted patients.</li>\n  <li>At national level, 92.9% of admitted patients (measured on an adjusted basis) and 98.2% of non-admitted patients completed their RTT pathway within a maximum of 18 weeks.</li>\n  <li>For patients still waiting for treatment (incomplete pathways) in May 2010, the median waiting time was 5.5 weeks and the 95th percentile was 23.4 weeks.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"changes-to-the-published-rtt-statistics---feedback-welcomed\">Changes to the published RTT statistics - feedback welcomed</h2>\n\n<p>The ‘Revision to the Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2010/11’, published in June 2010, stated that performance management of the 18 weeks waiting time target by the Department of Health has ceased. New statistical measures, the median and 95th percentile RTT waiting times, are being published every month to enable a fuller package of measures for the NHS, patients and the public to monitor waiting times for NHS treatment.</p>\n\n<p>The percentage of patients treated within 18 weeks will continue to be published alongside these new measures as it is still of interest to NHS organisations, patients and the public.</p>\n\n<p>We welcome feedback on the content and presentation of RTT statistics within the Statistical Press Notice and those published on the DH website. If anyone has any comments on this, or any other issues regarding RTT data and statistics, then please</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"mailto:data18weeks@dh.gsi.gov.uk\">email: data18weeks@dh.gsi.gov.uk  (opens new window)</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>","change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2010-07-15T01:00:00.000+01:00","note":"First published."}],"documents":["<section class=\"attachment embedded\" id=\"attachment_225196\">\n  <div class=\"attachment-thumb\">\n      <a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/153557/dh_117435.pdf\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/153557/thumbnail_dh_117435.pdf.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"attachment-details\">\n    <h2 class=\"title\"><a aria-describedby=\"attachment-225196-accessibility-help\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/153557/dh_117435.pdf\">Full press release </a></h2>\n    <p class=\"metadata\">\n        <span class=\"type\"><abbr title=\"Portable Document Format\">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class=\"file-size\">109KB</span>, <span class=\"page-length\">7 pages</span>\n    </p>\n\n\n      <div data-module=\"toggle\" class=\"accessibility-warning\" id=\"attachment-225196-accessibility-help\">\n        <h2>This file may not be suitable for users of assistive technology.\n          <a class=\"toggler\" href=\"#attachment-225196-accessibility-request\" data-controls=\"attachment-225196-accessibility-request\" data-expanded=\"false\">Request an accessible format.</a>\n        </h2>\n        <p id=\"attachment-225196-accessibility-request\" class=\"js-hidden\">\n          If you use assistive technology (eg a screen reader) and need a\nversion of this document in a more accessible format, please email <a href=\"mailto:publications@dh.gsi.gov.uk%20?body=Details%20of%20document%20required%3A%0A%0A%20%20Title%3A%20Full%20press%20release%20%0A%20%20Original%20format%3A%20pdf%0A%0APlease%20tell%20us%3A%0A%0A%20%201.%20What%20makes%20this%20format%20unsuitable%20for%20you%3F%0A%20%202.%20What%20format%20you%20would%20prefer%3F%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;subject=Request%20for%20%27Full%20press%20release%20%27%20in%20an%20alternative%20format\">publications@dh.gsi.gov.uk </a>.\nPlease tell us what format you need.
