{"title":"NHS Referral to Treatment waiting times statistics, September 2010","public_updated_at":"2010-11-18T00:00:00Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>The United Kingdom Statistics Authority has designated these statistics as National Statistics, in accordance with the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 and signifying compliance with the Code of Practice for Official Statistics. Designation can be broadly interpreted to mean that the statistics:<br>\n- meet identified user needs;<br>\n- are well explained and readily accessible;<br>\n- are produced according to sound methods, and<br>\n- are managed impartially and objectively in the public interest.</p>\n\n<p>Once statistics have been designated as National Statistics it is a statutory requirement that the Code of Practice shall continue to be observed.</p>\n\n<p>The latest monthly National Statistics on NHS Referral to Treatment (RTT) waiting times produced by the Department of Health were released on 18 November 2010 according to the arrangements approved by the UK Statistics Authority.</p>\n\n<p>NHS RTT waiting times figures for the month ending September 2010 include data for England, Primary Care Trusts, Strategic Health Authorities, and NHS Trusts.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"changes-to-the-published-rtt-statistics---feedback-welcomed\">Changes to the published RTT statistics - feedback welcomed</h2>\n\n<p>The ‘Revision to the Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2010/11’, published in June 2010, stated that performance management of the 18 weeks waiting time target by the Department of Health has ceased. New statistical measures, the median and 95th percentile RTT waiting times, are being published every month to enable a fuller package of measures for the NHS, patients and the public to monitor waiting times for NHS treatment. The percentage of patients treated within 18 weeks will continue to be published alongside these new measures as it is still of interest to NHS organisations, patients and the public.</p>\n\n<p>We welcome feedback on the content and presentation of RTT statistics within the Statistical Press Notice and those published on the DH website. If anyone has any comments on this, or any other issues regarding RTT data and statistics, then please email <a href=\"mailto:data18weeks@dh.gsi.gov.uk\">data18weeks@dh.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>\n</div>","change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2010-11-18T00:00:00.000+00:00","note":"First published."}],"documents":["<section class=\"attachment embedded\" id=\"attachment_225201\">\n  <div class=\"attachment-thumb\">\n      <a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/153555/dh_121767.pdf\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/153555/thumbnail_dh_121767.pdf.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"attachment-details\">\n    <h2 class=\"title\"><a aria-describedby=\"attachment-225201-accessibility-help\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/153555/dh_121767.pdf\">Full press release </a></h2>\n    <p class=\"metadata\">\n        <span class=\"type\"><abbr title=\"Portable Document Format\">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class=\"file-size\">68.2KB</span>, <span class=\"page-length\">8 pages</span>\n    </p>\n\n\n      <div data-module=\"toggle\" class=\"accessibility-warning\" id=\"attachment-225201-accessibility-help\">\n        <h2>This file may not be suitable for users of assistive technology.\n          <a class=\"toggler\" href=\"#attachment-225201-accessibility-request\" data-controls=\"attachment-225201-accessibility-request\" data-expanded=\"false\">Request an accessible format.</a>\n        </h2>\n        <p id=\"attachment-225201-accessibility-request\" class=\"js-hidden\">\n          If you use assistive technology (eg a screen reader) and need a\nversion of this document in a more accessible format, please email <a href=\"mailto:?body=Details%20of%20document%20required%3A%0A%0A%20%20Title%3A%20Full%20press%20release%20%0A%20%20Original%20format%3A%20pdf%0A%0APlease%20tell%20us%3A%0A%0A%20%201.%20What%20makes%20this%20format%20unsuitable%20for%20you%3F%0A%20%202.%20What%20format%20you%20would%20prefer%3F%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;subject=Request%20for%20%27Full%20press%20release%20%27%20in%20an%20alternative%20format\"></a>.\nPlease tell us what format you need.
