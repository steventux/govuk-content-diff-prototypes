We have since fully recovered and are now offering our best service levels in years.</p>\n\n  <p>Over the past six months we’ve consistently answered calls in an average of six minutes, and have launched new online tax accounts and webchat for everyone, enabling customers to manage their tax affairs wherever and whenever they want.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">There’s never been a better or more convenient service for our customers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr> achieved improvements to customer service by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>recruiting more than 3,000 additional advisers who can work outside normal office hours when many customers choose to call <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr>\n</li>\n  <li>introducing more flexible working to deal with large fluctuations in customer demand throughout the year, underpinned by a new telephone system that enables <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr> to move calls around the country in response to demand</li>\n  <li>launching online services that enable customers to manage their tax affairs when and where they want, including by smartphone, with online support such as webchats.
