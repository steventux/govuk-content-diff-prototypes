We are working closely with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to identify some of the most vulnerable displaced Syrians and bring them to the UK.</p>\n\n<p>This scheme is helping those in the greatest need who cannot be supported effectively in the region by giving them protection and support in the UK. The criteria for acceptance under the scheme will be expanded to ensure more of those in need are resettled.</p>\n\n<p>We have received many generous offers of support from the general public, local authorities, businesses and other organisations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-to-do-if-you-want-to-help\">What to do if you want to help</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>What you are offering</th>\n      <th>What to do</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Local authorities</td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>I’m a local authority and I want to get more information on the scheme and how to participate.</td>\n      <td>Read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/refugees\">information about refugees</a> on the  Local Government Association’s website.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td> </td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>I have a property that could be used to house refugees.</td>\n      <td>If you’re a local authority, email the Local Government Association, clearly stating which area of the UK you are in.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Children - education providers</td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>I am a local authority or school looking for additional training to help build the emotional resilience of children in our care.</td>\n      <td>Save the Children may have <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/emergencies-uk\">training opportunities</a> that you’d be interested in.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Children - fostering</td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>I want to foster a child.</td>\n      <td>It’s not possible currently to anticipate the level of foster places that will be needed.
