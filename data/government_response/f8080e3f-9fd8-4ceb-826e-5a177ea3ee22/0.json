{"title":"Update on PrEP Impact trial in England","public_updated_at":"2017-04-10T09:23:34Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>Considerable progress has been made in preparing for the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nhs-england-and-phe-extend-hiv-prevention-programme\"><abbr title=\"Human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> pre-exposure prophylaxis (<abbr title=\"pre-exposure prophylaxis\">PrEP</abbr>) trial</a> that was announced by NHS England and <abbr title=\"Public Health England\">PHE</abbr> last December as a major extension to the  <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.hivpreventionengland.org.uk/about/\">national <abbr title=\"Human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> prevention programme</a>. The trial, called the <abbr title=\"pre-exposure prophylaxis\">PrEP</abbr> Impact Trial, will include at least 10,000 participants over the next 3 years and will answer key outstanding questions on the extent of need, uptake and duration of use of <abbr title=\"pre-exposure prophylaxis\">PrEP</abbr> in the setting of sexually transmitted infection (<abbr title=\"sexually transmitted infection\">STI</abbr>) clinics in England. Our aim is to have the trial started by the summer of 2017.</p>\n\n<p>The trial protocol is complete, trial participant eligibility criteria have been endorsed by experts in the field and by community representatives, and independent peer review has been conducted. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title=\"Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\">MHRA</abbr>) has been consulted about trial categorisation and a relevant opinion received.  Submission for ethics committee approval is imminent.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"sexually transmitted infection\">STI</abbr> clinic attendees considered to be at high risk of acquiring <abbr title=\"Human immunodeficiency virus\">HIV</abbr> will be eligible to participate in the trial. Heterosexual and transgender individuals and gay men will be clinically risk-assessed as part of combination prevention and those at high risk offered <abbr title=\"pre-exposure prophylaxis\">PrEP</abbr>. To ensure equity of access across the country, the trial sites will include as many as possible of the over 200 level-3 <abbr title=\"sexually transmitted infection\">STI</abbr> clinics.</p>\n\n<p>A number of <abbr title=\"sexually transmitted infection\">STI</abbr> clinics have expressed an interest in joining the trial. Site participation standards are being finalised and all level-3 <abbr title=\"sexually transmitted infection\">STI</abbr> clinics will be written to in the next 2 weeks enquiring about capacity, willingness to meet the standards and to be a trial site.  The likely trial site and per-participant costs are being assessed prior to detailed discussion with the trial management team which will include <abbr title=\"sexually transmitted infection\">STI</abbr> service provider representation.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Public Health England\">PHE</abbr>â€™s Prevention Innovation Fund in 2017 to 2018 is seeking proposals that will address knowledge, awareness and understanding of <abbr title=\"pre-exposure prophylaxis\">PrEP</abbr> and other <abbr title=\"pre-exposure prophylaxis\">PrEP</abbr> related questions, especially in currently under-served populations in the community (e.g. higher-risk heterosexuals, black and minority ethnic group gay men and transgender communities).  To register interest in the fund please send an email with your name, email address and organisation name to <a href=\"mailto:hiv.prevention@phe.gov.uk\">hiv.prevention@phe.gov.uk</a>.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"pre-exposure prophylaxis\">PrEP</abbr> drug supply will be paid for and secured by NHS England.  Competitive procurement has begun and all relevant supplier-manufacturers have been written to.  A market engagement meeting is scheduled for later in April as part of this process.</p>\n\n<p>Overarching governance arrangements, in the form of a <abbr title=\"pre-exposure prophylaxis\">PrEP</abbr> Programme Oversight Board with joint leadership from <abbr title=\"Public Health England\">PHE</abbr> and NHS England, is in place to support the trial and to use the findings to prepare for a subsequent <abbr title=\"pre-exposure prophylaxis\">PrEP</abbr> programme.  Membership includes the Local Government Association (<abbr title=\"Local Government Association\">LGA</abbr>) and the Association of Directors of Public Health (<abbr title=\"Association of Directors of Public Health\">ADPH</abbr>).</p>\n\n</div>","emphasised_organisations":["1343f283-19e9-4fbb-86b1-58c7549d874b","f07b4bb8-8af6-42da-a161-3d90027e980c"],"change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2017-04-10T10:23:34.000+01:00","note":"First published."}],"image":{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/63110/s300_HIV_virus_960x640.jpg","caption":null,"alt_text":"An image of the HIV pathogen"},"first_public_at":"2017-04-10T10:23:34.000+01:00","political":false,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","current":true},"tags":{"browse_pages":[],"policies":[],"topics":[]}},"routes":[{"path":"/government/news/update-on-prep-impact-trial-in-england","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"government_response","schema_name":"news_article","first_published_at":"2017-04-10T09:23:34Z","base_path":"/government/news/update-on-prep-impact-trial-in-england","description":"In response to stakeholders, Public Health England (PHE) and NHS England have published an update on the PrEP Impact Trial.
