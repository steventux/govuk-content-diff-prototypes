The <abbr title=\"National Institute for Health Research\">NIHR</abbr> welcomes funding applications for research into any aspect of human health, including <abbr title=\"age-related macular degeneration\">AMD</abbr>. These applications are subject to peer review and judged in open competition, with awards being made on the basis of the importance of the topic to patients and health and care services, value for money and scientific quality. In all disease areas, the amount of <abbr title=\"National Institute for Health Research\">NIHR</abbr> funding depends on the volume and quality of scientific activity.</p>\n\n<p>The Medical Research Council (<abbr title=\"Medical Research Council\">MRC</abbr>) is one of the main agencies through which the government supports medical and clinical research. It is an independent research funding body that receives its grant-in-aid from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The <abbr title=\"Medical Research Council\">MRC</abbr> supports research through a range of grants and personal awards to scientists in universities, medical schools and other research institutes and welcomes investigator-initiated research proposals in all areas of research relevant to human health. Awards are made on the basis of the scientific quality of the proposals.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Medical Research Council\">MRC</abbr> has awarded £5.6 million for an early phase trial of magacizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody, in patients with neo-vascular <abbr title=\"age-related macular degeneration\">AMD</abbr>.</p>\n\n</div>","emphasised_organisations":["7cd6bf12-bbe9-4118-8523-f927b0442156"],"change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2016-11-21T16:56:56.000+00:00","note":"First published."}],"image":{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/default_news_organisation_image_data/file/72/s300_RH_Flickr_image_960x640.jpg","caption":null,"alt_text":"placeholder"},"first_public_at":"2016-11-21T16:56:56.000+00:00","political":true,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","current":true},"tags":{"browse_pages":[],"policies":[],"topics":[]}},"routes":[{"path":"/government/news/funding-for-age-related-macular-degeneration-research-campaign","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"whitehall-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"government_response","schema_name":"news_article","first_published_at":"2016-11-21T16:56:56Z","base_path":"/government/news/funding-for-age-related-macular-degeneration-research-campaign","description":"The Department of Health's response to the Macular Society’s campaign for funding for research into age-related macular degeneration (AMD).","content_id":"61064d8d-9115-48a7-b3b4-9042b336ceb8","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"D12","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/department-of-health","base_path":"/government/organisations/department-of-health","content_id":"7cd6bf12-bbe9-4118-8523-f927b0442156","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-07-18T17:26:50Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Department of Health","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"department-of-health","logo":{"formatted_title":"Department<br/>of Health","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}}],"policy_areas":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/government/topics/national-health-service","base_path":"/government/topics/national-health-service","content_id":"7aa4e8aa-0466-414c-bfa8-36e4f3c9fdf9","description":null,"document_type":"placeholder_policy_area","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-02-04T11:25:07Z","schema_name":"placeholder_policy_area","title":"National Health Service","withdrawn":false,"links":{}}],"available_translations":[{"title":"Funding for age-related macular degeneration research campaign","public_updated_at":"2016-11-21T16:56:56Z","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"government_response","schema_name":"news_article","base_path":"/government/news/funding-for-age-related-macular-degeneration-research-campaign","description":"The Department of Health's response to the Macular Society’s campaign for funding for research into age-related macular degeneration (AMD).","api_path":"/api/content/government/news/funding-for-age-related-macular-degeneration-research-campaign","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"61064d8d-9115-48a7-b3b4-9042b336ceb8","locale":"en"}]},"format":"news_article","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"announcements","government_document_supertype":"government-responses","payload_version":0}
