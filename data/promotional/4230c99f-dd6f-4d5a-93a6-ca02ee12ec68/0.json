Offering new and improved opportunities for tourism and trade.</p>\n\n<p>The potential expansion of Heathrow would have an impact on local communities. The government is clear that a world-class package of measures should be put in place to support them. Expansion can happen within existing air quality requirements. This will be a condition of planning approval.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/draft-airports-national-policy-statement\">draft Airports National Policy Statement</a> sets out the policy that applies to decisions on whether major infrastructure projects can go ahead.</p>\n\n<p>We are running a 16 week public consultation on the draft Airports National Policy Statement. The consultation will include local events for people to find out more about the proposals.</p>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p>Please have your say on Heathrow expansion.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2017-02-02T11:22:44.000+00:00","note":"First published."}],"documents":["<section class=\"attachment embedded\" id=\"attachment_1932476\">\n  <div class=\"attachment-thumb\">\n      <a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/587632/heathrow-expansion-have-your-say.pdf\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/587632/thumbnail_heathrow-expansion-have-your-say.pdf.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"attachment-details\">\n    <h2 class=\"title\"><a aria-describedby=\"attachment-1932476-accessibility-help\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/587632/heathrow-expansion-have-your-say.pdf\">Heathrow expansion: have your say</a></h2>\n    <p class=\"metadata\">\n        <span class=\"type\"><abbr title=\"Portable Document Format\">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class=\"file-size\">1.17MB</span>, <span class=\"page-length\">2 pages</span>\n    </p>\n\n\n      <div data-module=\"toggle\" class=\"accessibility-warning\" id=\"attachment-1932476-accessibility-help\">\n        <h2>This file may not be suitable for users of assistive technology.\n          <a class=\"toggler\" href=\"#attachment-1932476-accessibility-request\" data-controls=\"attachment-1932476-accessibility-request\" data-expanded=\"false\">Request an accessible format.</a>\n        </h2>\n        <p id=\"attachment-1932476-accessibility-request\" class=\"js-hidden\">\n          If you use assistive technology (such as a screen reader) and need a\nversion of this document in a more accessible format, please email <a href=\"mailto:webmasterdft@dft.gsi.gov.uk?body=Details%20of%20document%20required%3A%0A%0A%20%20Title%3A%20Heathrow%20expansion%3A%20have%20your%20say%0A%20%20Original%20format%3A%20pdf%0A%0APlease%20tell%20us%3A%0A%0A%20%201.%20What%20makes%20this%20format%20unsuitable%20for%20you%3F%0A%20%202.%20What%20format%20you%20would%20prefer%3F%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;subject=Request%20for%20%27Heathrow%20expansion%3A%20have%20your%20say%27%20in%20an%20alternative%20format\">webmasterdft@dft.gsi.gov.uk</a>.\nPlease tell us what format you need.
