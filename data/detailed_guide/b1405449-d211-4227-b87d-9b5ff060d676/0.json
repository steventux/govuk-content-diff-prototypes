The regulator will use this information to assess compliance with the regulatory framework and to produce statistical information. We are committed to minimising the burden of our information requirements through the best use of information that providers will readily have to hand, or may have published, as part of their routine business activity.</p>\n\n<p>The regulator expects providers to produce the information and documents it requires on a timely basis. Where the regulator has evidence that information of any nature has not been submitted or is late, incomplete, or inaccurate, this may be reflected in our judgement of a provider’s compliance with the regulatory standards. In particular, but not exclusively, it may provide evidence of a breach of the specific expectation in the Governance and Financial Viability Standard to communicate with the regulator in an accurate and timely manner, including through regulatory returns.</p>\n\n<p>The tables below set out a summary of our routine data requirements and the deadlines for submission. Please submit the returns as early as possible. There are different requirements for those providers which own fewer than 1,000 social housing units and those which own 1,000 units or more. Local authorities do not need to submit the information below.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"data-returns\">Data returns</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Data returns</th>\n      <th>Deadline</th>\n      <th>Which providers</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistical-data-return-statistical-releases\">Statistical Data Return</a></td>\n      <td>31 May each year</td>\n      <td>All registered providers (shorter returns for providers owning fewer than 1,000 social housing  units)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Financial Forecast Return (FFR) to be accompanied with business plan and other supporting documentation.</td>\n      <td>30 June each year final deadline for all providers with 31 March financial year end.

NROSH+ is a website for all registered providers (except local authority providers) to submit their annual data returns – the information and supporting documents which we require so we can regulate them effectively.</p>\n\n<p>As a provider, it is essential that you supply accurate and timely data – the data returns are an important way in which we monitor big financial risks and regulate the sector. Further guidance on submitting NROSH+ data returns is provided on the NROSH+ website. Guidance on submitting annual accounts and audit management letters is provided below.</p>\n\n<p>The Disposal Proceeds Fund annual return is submitted on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/investment-management-system-access-guidance-and-support\">IMS system</a>.
