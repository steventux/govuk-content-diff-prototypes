The Panel provides advice to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/guidance/become-an-open-standards-challenge-owner\">Challenge Owners</a> leading the work to adopt open standards. It also evaluates proposals to make evidence-based recommendations to the Open Standards Board.</p>\n\n<p>The panel evaluates proposals and quality assures the work of Challenge Owners by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>making sure stakeholders have been engaged and informed throughout the development of proposal(s) relating to a specific challenge</li>\n  <li>verifying proposals put forward by challenge owners have been adequately researched and that there is sufficient evidence for the panel to agree on a recommendation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After assuring the work of Challenge Owners, the panel makes recommendations to the Open Standards Board, advising on whether a proposed standard is achievable and the potential impact its adoption may have on current systems.</p>\n\n<p>Decisions on open standards will be made by the Panel Chair and will be based on a consensus of the Panel. The Chair is invited to attend the Open Standards Board to represent the Panel’s recommendations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"about-the-panel-chair\">About the Panel Chair</h2>\n\n<p>The Panel Chair is a civil servant or public servant nominated by the Open Standards team and approved by the Chair of the Open Standards Board.
