{"title":"Source sustainable palm oil: guidance for public sector buyers","public_updated_at":"2014-07-07T14:07:06Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><h2 id=\"buying-sustainably-government-procurers\">Buying sustainably: government procurers</h2>\n\n<p>The UK government’s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://sd.defra.gov.uk/advice/public/buying/products/food/standards/\">Food and Catering Government Buying Standard (GBS)</a> requires that from the end of 2015 all palm oil (including palm kernel oil and products derived from palm oil) used for cooking and as an ingredient in food must be sustainably produced.</p>\n\n<p>As part of a Government Buying Standard, the policy is mandatory for all central government departments, their executive agencies and executive non departmental public bodies and non-ministerial departments under the greening government commitments.  Local authorities, other public bodies and the private sector are also encouraged to adopt sustainable procurement policies.</p>\n\n<p>However, changes to the European Food Information Regulations will mean labels have to identify the specific types of vegetable oils that have been used, so it will be easier for consumers to identify products with palm oil as an ingredient. Businesses are beginning to implement the change, which will be mandatory on all food products from 13 December 2014. Visit the EC webpage on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/foodlabelling/proposed_legislation_en.htm\">European Food Information for Consumers Regulations</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"commitment-of-100-sourcing-of-sustainable-palm-oil\">Commitment of 100% sourcing of sustainable palm oil</h2>\n\n<p>The United Kingdom is also working towards achieving <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sustainable-production-of-palm-oil-uk-statement\">100% sourcing of credibly certified sustainable palm oil</a> by the end of 2015.</p>\n\n<p>Government procurers and businesses: see the statement for advice on sourcing sustainable palm oil.</p>\n\n<p>Action is voluntary, apart from where palm oil is used as a biofuel.  Then there are <a href=\"#RTFO\">mandatory requirements for sustainability</a>.  Many large businesses and trade associations have already made public commitments on sustainable sourcing.</p>\n\n<p>To see how the UK is progressing on their commitment, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-statement-on-sustainable-palm-oil-one-year-on-progress-report\">see this summary report</a> into progress made over the last 12 months in sourcing sustainable palm oil.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sustainable-palm-oil-criteria-and-certification-schemes\">Sustainable palm oil: criteria and certification schemes</h2>\n\n<p>There is no single, straightforward universally-applied definition of what is ‘sustainable palm oil’.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-businesses-can-do-to-source-sustainable-palm-oil\">What businesses can do to source sustainable palm oil</h3>\n\n<p>Efforts have been made to produce palm oil more sustainably, with different schemes and approaches developed to help buyers identify supplies of sustainable palm oil and palm oil products and to meet other demands. Businesses can contact the certification schemes, to buy certified sustainable palm oil.  The schemes include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.rspo.org/\">Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification</a> - a multi-stakeholder approach, bringing together producers, retailers, traders, NGOs and other stakeholders, in this voluntary best practice certification scheme. To date is by far the largest global sustainable palm oil scheme</li>\n  <li>Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO)</li>\n  <li>Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO)</li>\n  <li>organic - there are many organic certification schemes covering a wide range of agriculture-based products. A large international umbrella organisation is <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ifoam.org/\">IFOAM</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Other schemes that businesses could get involved in include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/energy/renewables/biofuels/land_use_change_en.htm\">Renewable Energy Directive (RED)</a> - the EU RED applies to all biofuels, including those derived from palm oil. Biofuel subsidies only apply if the sustainability requirements are met</li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/renewable-transport-fuels-obligation\">UK Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO)</a> - UK scheme setting requirements for sustainability of transport fuels, including those derived from palm oil.  Biofuel subsidies only apply if the sustainability requirements are met</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information on the background of these schemes, please <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.cpet.org.uk/palm-oil-folder/what-is-sustainable-palm-oil-1\">go to the archived pages of the old CPET website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For background regional information on where palm oil is produced, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.sustainablepalmoil.org/palm-oil-by-region/\">sustainable palm oil platform (SPP) regional section</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"consumption-analysis-of-sustainable-palm-oil-in-the-uk\">Consumption analysis of sustainable palm oil in the UK</h2>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-consumption-of-sustainable-palm-oil-annual-review\">review of UK purchases of palm oil</a> was carried out by CPET in 2013.  We found out how much palm oil was sourced sustainably in 2012, and measured progress on the 100% sustainable palm oil commitment.  The next annual update will be available in October/November 2014.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-cpet-can-help\">How CPET can help</h2>\n\n<p>We provide ways to engage and support suppliers through stakeholder engagement, newsletters, and our helpdesk. Our free workshops give an overall understanding of sustainable palm oil, introducing supply chain certification and giving an overview of the Food and Catering Government Buying Standard requirement for sustainable palm oil to all UK government buyers and their suppliers.
