This programme is open to the following in the North West and South East:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>School Direct lead schools</li>\n  <li>higher education institutions (<abbr title=\"higher education institutions\">HEIs</abbr>)</li>\n  <li>multi-academy trusts (<abbr title=\"multi-academy trusts\">MATs</abbr>)</li>\n  <li>teaching school alliances (<abbr title=\"teaching school alliances\">TSAs</abbr>)</li>\n  <li>school-centred initial teacher training providers (<abbr title=\"school-centred initial teacher training providers (SCITTs)\">SCITTs</abbr>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The aim of the pilot is to test whether state funded secondary schools in\nEngland can improve teacher recruitment in mathematics, physics and modern\nforeign languages (<abbr title=\"modern foreign languages\">MFL</abbr>), by providing a bespoke package of support to\nqualified teachers who are currently not teaching in state funded schools in\nEngland but wish to return. This support will then lead to returning teachers\ngaining employment within the partnership schools.</p>\n\n<p>The programme is available to former teachers wishing to return to mathematics, physics, or a modern foreign language in the North West and South East.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a returner looking to participate in this programme please visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/\">Get into Teaching website</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"who-can-apply\">Who can apply</h2>\n\n<p>In order to apply, lead schools, <abbr title=\"higher education institutions\">HEIs</abbr> and school partnerships must be able to demonstrate that they wish to address a shortfall in recruitment in mathematics, physics and <abbr title=\"modern foreign languages\">MFL</abbr>. Schools must see this as an exercise to employ the returners they recruit onto the programme, including those who wish to return on a part-time or flexible basis..</p>\n\n<p>You should assess your unfilled vacancies and request funding to support the number of returners you will employ. Over-supply of returners to the partnership is not the intention: the intended outcome of participating in this pilot should be to employ a returner. A clear number of vacancies should be identified in the application, and this should equate to the number of returners requested. Applications will be assessed on how well measures to ensure this number of vacancies will be filled are set out.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"National College for Teaching and Leadership\">NCTL</abbr> will provide a number of potential returners. You should include details of how you will do this in your application.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"application-criteria\">Application criteria</h3>\n\n<p>In order to apply, you must:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>have a network of school contacts to ensure vacancies are available for returners at each cohort point</li>\n  <li>be able to add more schools to your partnership throughout the duration of the course to ensure vacancies across your network can be filled by returner teachers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"dates\">Dates</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Application round opened</td>\n      <td>Friday 27 January 2017</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Application round closed</td>\n      <td>Monday 20 February 2017</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Outcomes communicated by</td>\n      <td>Friday 3 March 2017</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Start-up meeting</td>\n      <td>March 2017</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2 id=\"whats-involved\">What’s involved</h2>\n\n<p>Successful pilot schools will be invited to take part in a start-up meeting with other pilot schools. These meetings will be arranged and chaired by the <abbr title=\"National College for Teaching and Leadership\">NCTL</abbr>. The meetings will to offer support and help with the planning and design of the upcoming programme, and for pilot schools to share best practice.This is supported by a national marketing campaign by <abbr title=\"National College for Teaching and Leadership\">NCTL</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>Return to Teaching Advisors will contact the returners to evaluate their needs. Returners who are deemed eligible for the Returners Engagement Programme pilot will be referred to pilot schools in their local area. Eligible returners will be those who are serious about returning within 2 terms but who lack up to date classroom experience.</p>\n\n<p>You will interview the returner to decide who is an appropriate candidate.  You must only recruit returners where there is a very good chance of employing them once the appropriate support has been given.</p>\n\n<p>Participants will receive support and training from your school based on their individual needs. This must include teaching experience, and might also include training on pedagogy and curriculum changes and support with behaviour management. The 2 -  4 week course will be tailored to the needs of the returning teacher, so some may receive more or longer training than others dependant on their individual requirements.</p>\n\n<p>All background checks are the responsibility of the pilot lead. These will not be reimbursed, but start-up funding can be used to cover the cost of any checks the pilot lead deems necessary.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"expectations-of-schools\">Expectations of schools</h3>\n\n<p>If successful, you will be required to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>attend a start-up meeting in the week commencing 6 March 2017</li>\n  <li>assess returners’ suitability when they are referred to the pilot</li>\n  <li>ensure that returning teachers attend an interview with the line manager of the role they will ultimately apply for within the partnership</li>\n  <li>only recruit returners on a realistic and rigorous assessment of current and forthcoming vacancies in mathematics, physics and <abbr title=\"modern foreign languages\">MFL</abbr>\n</li>\n  <li>recruit returners with the intention of employment within the school partnership, within 2 terms of completion of their training (this can be part-time or full-time)</li>\n  <li>recruit returners who wish to return to teach mathematics, physics and <abbr title=\"modern foreign languages\">MFL</abbr>, and who are registered with the <abbr title=\"National College for Teaching and Leadership\">NCTL</abbr> and have been referred to you via the Return to Teaching Advisors</li>\n  <li>source additional mathematics, physics and <abbr title=\"modern foreign languages\">MFL</abbr> returners to the programme, however must ensure these additional returners register with the <abbr title=\"National College for Teaching and Leadership\">NCTL</abbr> prior to their training commencing</li>\n  <li>provide support to recruited returners free of charge to the participant</li>\n  <li>collate and submit participant data, including <abbr title=\"National College for Teaching and Leadership\">NCTL</abbr> returner reference numbers</li>\n  <li>provide case studies and participant feedback.
