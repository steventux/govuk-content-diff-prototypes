It follows the publication in December 2015 of the Rochford Review’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rochford-review-interim-recommendations\">interim recommendations</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The final report’s recommendations include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the removal of the statutory requirement to assess pupils with SEND who are working below the standard using performance scales (P scales)</li>\n  <li>that the interim pre-key stage standards for pupils working below the standard of national curriculum tests are made permanent and extended to include all pupils engaged in subject-specific learning</li>\n  <li>that schools assess pupils’ development in all 4 areas of need outlined in the SEND Code of Practice, but statutory assessment for pupils who are not engaged in subject-specific learning should be limited to the area of cognition and learning</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We will consult on the report’s recommendations in early 2017. Final decisions will be made following that consultation.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime schools should continue to use the pre-key stage standards and P scales for the statutory assessment of pupils working below the standard of the national curriculum tests.</p>\n\n<p>The interim pre-key stage standards for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2017-pre-key-stage-1-pupils-working-below-the-test-standard\">key stage 1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2017-pre-key-stage-2-pupils-working-below-the-test-standard\">key stage 2</a> and more information about the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/the-rochford-review\">review group</a> are also available.</p>\n\n</div>","change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2016-10-19T18:27:54.000+01:00","note":"First published."}],"documents":["<section class=\"attachment embedded\" id=\"attachment_1769428\">\n  <div class=\"attachment-thumb\">\n      <a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/561411/Rochford_Review_Report_v5_PFDA.pdf\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/561411/thumbnail_Rochford_Review_Report_v5_PFDA.pdf.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"attachment-details\">\n    <h2 class=\"title\"><a href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/561411/Rochford_Review_Report_v5_PFDA.pdf\">The Rochford Review: final report</a></h2>\n    <p class=\"metadata\">\n        <span class=\"references\">\n          Ref: ISBN <span class=\"isbn\">978-1-78644-248-2</span>, <span class=\"unique_reference\">STA/16/7703/e</span>\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"type\"><abbr title=\"Portable Document Format\">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class=\"file-size\">946KB</span>, <span class=\"page-length\">38 pages</span>\n    </p>\n\n\n  </div>\n</section>"],"emphasised_organisations":["863ffacd-d313-49c1-b856-58fe0799fd41"],"political":false,"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","current":true},"tags":{"browse_pages":[],"policies":[],"topics":[]},"first_public_at":"2016-10-19T18:27:54.000+01:00"},"routes":[{"path":"/government/publications/rochford-review-final-report","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"whitehall-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"independent_report","schema_name":"publication","first_published_at":"2016-10-19T17:27:54Z","base_path":"/government/publications/rochford-review-final-report","description":"Statutory assessment arrangements for pupils working below the standard of national curriculum tests at key stages 1 and 2 (known as SATs).
