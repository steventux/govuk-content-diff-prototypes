{"title":"Local and national regulation: information sharing","public_updated_at":"2016-07-06T14:33:00Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>To fulfil their statutory obligations, regulators need to collect information about the businesses they regulate. In late 2015, the Centre of Excellence for Information Sharing was commissioned to work with local and national regulators to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>identify cultural barriers to information sharing within regulatory services</li>\n  <li>capture existing or emergent good practice</li>\n  <li>explore the characteristics of successful information sharing between regulators</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This report brings together learning obtained during the course of the investigations. It identifies good practice at the local and national level, explores common barriers, and highlights the characteristics of successful information sharing between regulators. It also presents a set of recommendations for how information sharing between regulators can be improved, enabling services to work more closely together to deliver better outcomes for business and communities.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://informationsharing.org.uk\">Centre of Excellence for Information Sharing</a></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"related-resources\">Related resources</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/data-sharing-for-non-economic-regulators\">Data sharing for non-economic regulators</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-regulation-data-collection-from-regulatory-services\">Local regulation: data collection from regulatory services</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-regulation-data-collection-from-welsh-regulatory-services\">Local regulation: data collection from Welsh regulatory services</a></p>\n</div>","change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2016-07-06T15:33:00.000+01:00","note":"First published."}],"documents":["<section class=\"attachment embedded\" id=\"attachment_1706896\">\n  <div class=\"attachment-thumb\">\n      <a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/535439/overcoming-cultural-barriers.pdf\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/535439/thumbnail_overcoming-cultural-barriers.pdf.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"attachment-details\">\n    <h2 class=\"title\"><a aria-describedby=\"attachment-1706896-accessibility-help\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/535439/overcoming-cultural-barriers.pdf\">Overcoming cultural barriers to information sharing within regulatory services</a></h2>\n    <p class=\"metadata\">\n        <span class=\"type\"><abbr title=\"Portable Document Format\">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class=\"file-size\">1.08MB</span>, <span class=\"page-length\">20 pages</span>\n    </p>\n\n\n      <div data-module=\"toggle\" class=\"accessibility-warning\" id=\"attachment-1706896-accessibility-help\">\n        <h2>This file may not be suitable for users of assistive technology.\n          <a class=\"toggler\" href=\"#attachment-1706896-accessibility-request\" data-controls=\"attachment-1706896-accessibility-request\" data-expanded=\"false\">Request an accessible format.</a>\n        </h2>\n        <p id=\"attachment-1706896-accessibility-request\" class=\"js-hidden\">\n          If you use assistive technology (such as a screen reader) and need a\nversion of this document in a more accessible format, please email <a href=\"mailto:enquiries@beis.gov.uk?body=Details%20of%20document%20required%3A%0A%0A%20%20Title%3A%20Overcoming%20cultural%20barriers%20to%20information%20sharing%20within%20regulatory%20services%0A%20%20Original%20format%3A%20pdf%0A%0APlease%20tell%20us%3A%0A%0A%20%201.%20What%20makes%20this%20format%20unsuitable%20for%20you%3F%0A%20%202.%20What%20format%20you%20would%20prefer%3F%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;subject=Request%20for%20%27Overcoming%20cultural%20barriers%20to%20information%20sharing%20within%20regulatory%20services%27%20in%20an%20alternative%20format\">enquiries@beis.gov.uk</a>.\nPlease tell us what format you need.
