{"title":"River basin management: working together","public_updated_at":"2012-06-22T10:00:00Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>This consultation shared the objectives and measures set out in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/river-basin-management-plans-2015\">river basin management plans</a> and asked which issues stakeholders could contribute to.</p>\n\n<p>The consultation also gave the opportunity to suggest how to report on progress and to comment on the economic appraisal and environmental assessment work carried out.</p>\n\n<p>The consultation on the draft updated river basin management plans consists of 3 main parts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Part 1: Summary and consultation questions</li>\n  <li>Part 2: River basin management planning overview and additional information</li>\n  <li>Part 3: Economic analysis</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are also other supporting documents and data available to download to help you respond to this consultation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"part-1-summary-and-consultation-questions\">Part 1: Summary and consultation questions</h2>\n\n<p>There is a part 1 for each river basin district. It sets out the current state of the river basin district, the challenges it faces and the future objectives and measures that might apply. The questions for the consultation are listed in this document.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"part-2-river-basin-management-planning-overview-and-additional-information\">Part 2: River basin management planning overview and additional information</h2>\n\n<p>There is one part 2 document for England. This document sets out the detail behind the decision-making which has shaped this draft update to the river basin management plan. It explains each step of the process, linking to more detailed information where appropriate. It allows the user to find the level of detail desired to respond to the consultation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"part-3-economic-analysis\">Part 3: Economic analysis</h2>\n\n<p>There is one economic analysis for England. It has been produced to help people understand the potential implications of 5 future management scenarios for 4 of the sector groupings. Information on costs and benefits is summarised for each river basin district as well as for England.</p>\n\n<p>Alongside each part 1 there is a strategic environmental assessment report which we are also consulting on. This report considers the significant environmental effects to the draft update to the river basin management plan to ensure the plan takes these effects into account.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"supporting-information\">Supporting information</h2>\n\n<p>Supporting documents include a:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>record of consultation and engagement</li>\n  <li>coastal and estuarine waters national engagement summary</li>\n  <li>printable response form</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"catchment-summaries\">Catchment summaries</h2>\n\n<p>To help you respond to the consultation, we have summarised key information at a local scale in the catchment summaries.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"catchment-data-explorer\">Catchment Data Explorer</h2>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://environment.data.gov.uk/catchment-planning/\">Catchment Data Explorer</a> allows you to go to your geographic or subject area of interest. You can then select the scale you are most interested in and see the information about that area.</p>\n\n<p>The tool also enables you to download detailed background information that has been summarised in this document. These are the key datasets that support the river basin management plans and catchment summaries.</p>\n</div>","closing_date":"2012-12-22T23:45:00.000+00:00","emphasised_organisations":["16628142-57b2-4611-bc03-5912785acee3"],"opening_date":"2012-06-22T11:00:00.000+01:00","change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2012-06-22T11:00:00.000+01:00","note":"First published."}],"final_outcome_detail":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>The’ River basin management: working together consultation - acting on your feedback’ document:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>summarises the responses we received and the actions we have\nplanned as a result</li>\n  <li>reviews progress on the actions and provides an update on what has happened so far</li>\n</ul>\n</div>","final_outcome_documents":["<section class=\"attachment embedded\" id=\"attachment_1697950\">\n  <div class=\"attachment-thumb\">\n      <a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/541947/Working_Together_Acting_on_your_Feedback_document.pdf\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/541947/thumbnail_Working_Together_Acting_on_your_Feedback_document.pdf.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"attachment-details\">\n    <h2 class=\"title\"><a aria-describedby=\"attachment-1697950-accessibility-help\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/541947/Working_Together_Acting_on_your_Feedback_document.pdf\">River basin management: working together consultation - acting on your feedback</a></h2>\n    <p class=\"metadata\">\n        <span class=\"type\"><abbr title=\"Portable Document Format\">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class=\"file-size\">912KB</span>, <span class=\"page-length\">43 pages</span>\n    </p>\n\n\n      <div data-module=\"toggle\" class=\"accessibility-warning\" id=\"attachment-1697950-accessibility-help\">\n        <h2>This file may not be suitable for users of assistive technology.\n          <a class=\"toggler\" href=\"#attachment-1697950-accessibility-request\" data-controls=\"attachment-1697950-accessibility-request\" data-expanded=\"false\">Request an accessible format.</a>\n        </h2>\n        <p id=\"attachment-1697950-accessibility-request\" class=\"js-hidden\">\n          If you use assistive technology (such as a screen reader) and need a\nversion of this document in a more accessible format, please email <a href=\"mailto:enquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk?body=Details%20of%20document%20required%3A%0A%0A%20%20Title%3A%20River%20basin%20management%3A%20working%20together%20consultation%20-%20acting%20on%20your%20feedback%0A%20%20Original%20format%3A%20pdf%0A%0APlease%20tell%20us%3A%0A%0A%20%201.%20What%20makes%20this%20format%20unsuitable%20for%20you%3F%0A%20%202.%20What%20format%20you%20would%20prefer%3F%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;subject=Request%20for%20%27River%20basin%20management%3A%20working%20together%20consultation%20-%20acting%20on%20your%20feedback%27%20in%20an%20alternative%20format\">enquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk</a>.\nPlease tell us what format you need.
