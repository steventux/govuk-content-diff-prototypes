Each provider’s page contains their current and previous judgements. In some cases, as well as publishing a provider’s grades, we will also issue a narrative regulatory judgement report. We will usually do this where, for any reason, our assessment of that provider has changed, or there are new issues we want to make public.</p>\n\n<p>See an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-judgements-and-regulatory-notices\">explanation of the terms and the current and previous regulatory judgements table</a>.
