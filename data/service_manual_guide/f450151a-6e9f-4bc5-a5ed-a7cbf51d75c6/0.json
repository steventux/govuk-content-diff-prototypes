For example, it doesn’t need to be secure or to perform well with large volumes of traffic.</p>\n\n<p>The point is to test ideas as quickly as possible. If an idea tests well, you may want to work with a developer to make your code a bit clearer so that it&rsquo;s easier for others to work with.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-the-govuk-prototype-kit\">Using the GOV.UK prototype kit</h3>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit\">GOV.UK prototype kit</a> lets you build realistic prototypes of your service that look and behave like GOV.UK.</p>\n\n<p>It comes with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit/blob/master/docs/install/introduction.md\">detailed installation instructions</a> and some example pages to get you started.</p>\n\n<p>To use it you’ll need some basic knowledge of HTML, for example what tags and attributes are and how to copy and paste code.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can work with developers on your team to create prototypes together.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sharing-code-prototypes\">Sharing code prototypes</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"publishing-on-the-web\">Publishing on the web</h3>\n\n<p>You can share code prototypes by publishing them on the web.</p>\n\n<p>The GOV.UK prototype kit includes instructions for <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit/blob/master/docs/guides/publishing-on-heroku.md\">publishing prototypes</a> using a service called Heroku.</p>\n\n<p>When you&rsquo;ve uploaded your prototype, you can easily share it with others. You must protect access to your prototype with a password so that members of the public don’t find it and mistake it for a real service.</p>\n\n<p>You must not use the GOV.UK prototype kit to make live services. It’s designed for prototyping and does not have the security or performance features needed for a live service.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-code-collaboration-software\">Using code collaboration software</h3>\n\n<p>Multiple people can collaborate on the same prototype using software called Git. The GOV.UK prototype kit has guidance on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit/blob/master/docs/guides/setting-up-git.md\">how to set up Git for your prototypes</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"testing-your-prototypes\">Testing your prototypes</h2>\n\n<p>Read these user research guides to find out more about how to test your prototypes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/service-manual/user-research/how-user-research-improves-service-design\">How user research improves service design</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs\">Start by learning user needs</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/service-manual/user-research/plan-user-research-for-your-service\">Plan user research for your service</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/service-manual/user-research/plan-round-of-user-research\">Plan a round of user research</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"further-reading\">Further reading</h2>\n\n<p>Read these blog posts to find out more about prototyping:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2014/10/13/how-designers-prototype-at-gds/\">How designers prototype at <abbr title=\"Government Digital Service\">GDS</abbr></a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2014/05/22/gov-uk-sketching-templates/\">GOV.UK sketching templates</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/19/prototyping-tips/\">Prototyping tips</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n","header_links":[{"title":"Meeting the Digital Service Standard","href":"#meeting-the-digital-service-standard"},{"title":"When to use prototypes","href":"#when-to-use-prototypes"},{"title":"Types of prototype","href":"#types-of-prototype"},{"title":"Using code prototypes","href":"#using-code-prototypes"},{"title":"Sharing code prototypes","href":"#sharing-code-prototypes"},{"title":"Testing your prototypes","href":"#testing-your-prototypes"},{"title":"Further reading","href":"#further-reading"}],"change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2016-10-18T10:38:39Z","note":"Guidance first published","reason_for_change":""}],"change_note":"Guidance first published"},"routes":[{"type":"exact","path":"/service-manual/design/making-prototypes"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"service-manual-publisher","rendering_app":"service-manual-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"beta","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"service_manual_guide","schema_name":"service_manual_guide","first_published_at":"2016-10-18T12:27:37Z","base_path":"/service-manual/design/making-prototypes","description":"How to make design prototypes as you build your service.","content_id":"f450151a-6e9f-4bc5-a5ed-a7cbf51d75c6","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"content_owners":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/service-manual/communities/design-community","base_path":"/service-manual/communities/design-community","content_id":"9ea42648-634c-46b8-939d-948f63d227fd","description":"The design community is for anyone who wants to discuss and learn about the role of design in government.","document_type":"service_manual_guide","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-10-18T09:05:18Z","schema_name":"service_manual_guide","title":"Design community","withdrawn":false,"links":{}}],"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"OT1056","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/government-digital-service","base_path":"/government/organisations/government-digital-service","content_id":"af07d5a5-df63-4ddc-9383-6a666845ebe9","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-02-07T11:16:58Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Government Digital Service","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"cabinet-office","logo":{"formatted_title":"Government Digital Service","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}}],"service_manual_topics":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/service-manual/design","base_path":"/service-manual/design","content_id":"4b803c18-9473-4cbe-bc2e-39d269ed7063","description":"Naming your service, prototypes, frontend tools and design patterns.","document_type":"service_manual_topic","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-03-30T16:35:45Z","schema_name":"service_manual_topic","title":"Design","withdrawn":false,"links":{}}],"available_translations":[{"title":"Making prototypes","public_updated_at":"2016-10-18T12:27:37Z","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"service_manual_guide","schema_name":"service_manual_guide","base_path":"/service-manual/design/making-prototypes","description":"How to make design prototypes as you build your service.","api_path":"/api/content/service-manual/design/making-prototypes","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"f450151a-6e9f-4bc5-a5ed-a7cbf51d75c6","locale":"en"}]},"format":"service_manual_guide","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"other","government_document_supertype":"other","payload_version":0}
