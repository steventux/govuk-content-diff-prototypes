{"title":"Writing email and text messages to users","public_updated_at":null,"details":{"body":"<p>This guide explains how to write emails and text message notifications to users of your service.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re planning to send messages, you also need to think about:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-common-components\">using common components</a> (including GOV.UK Notify)</li>\n  <li>[how to protect users from spam and phishingXXXXX]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"meeting-the-digital-service-standard\">Meeting the Digital Service Standard</h2>\n\n<p>To pass <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/make-the-user-experience-consistent-with-govuk\">point 13 (make the user experience consistent with GOV.UK)</a> in your <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-you-need-a-service-assessment\">service assessments</a> you must use GOV.UK design patterns and guidance.</p>\n\n<p>Read the guide on <a href=\"/service-manual/design/using-adapting-and-creating-patterns\">using, adapting and creating design patterns</a> before you start writing or sending anything.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"plan-what-you-want-to-say\">Plan what you want to say</h2>\n\n<p>Before you write anything:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>make sure you understand what users need to know - only send messages that are timely and relevant</li>\n  <li>work out if an email or text message will more effective - if possible, use both</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you aren’t sure, do <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research\">user research</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"personalise-your-message\">Personalise your message</h2>\n\n<p>Users are more likely to trust information that’s clearly directed at them. This means you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>make sure your message is relevant - it might confuse the user if they can’t see how it relates to their situation</li>\n  <li>tailor your message to the user - for example, use ‘visa application’ for the email subject line rather than a reference number or something generic like ‘Application’</li>\n  <li>start emails with ‘Dear [name]’ not ‘Hi’ as some users find it too informal - you don’t need either for text messages</li>\n  <li>say who the message is from - the name of your service might mean more to the user than your department or agency name</li>\n  <li>avoid calling users ‘customers’ - they don’t have a choice about whether to use government services</li>\n  <li>include a reference number (if you have one)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"tell-users-only-what-they-need-to-know\">Tell users only what they need to know</h2>\n\n<p>It’s easier for users to read and understand messages if they’re short and to the point. When writing a message:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>start with the most important information - this means the user will be more likely see it, especially if their device or software shortens email subject lines or previews text messages</li>\n  <li>say only one important thing - if you have several important things to say, you might need to send more than one message</li>\n  <li>write just enough so the user will know what to do without needing to contact you for help - don’t explain your service, process or policy</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"give-clear-instructions\">Give clear instructions</h2>\n\n<p>Make it easy for users to understand what they need to do and what’s happening next. To do this, you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>include the date and time of any deadlines</li>\n  <li>make it clear what you need the user to do - for example ‘Complete this form and send it back to us by 20 May’</li>\n  <li>say what will happen if they don’t do what you’re asking - for example, ‘If you don’t pay by 20 May, you’ll have to apply for a new licence’</li>\n  <li>tell the user what you’ll do next and when they’ll hear from you - if you won’t be contacting them again, make it clear it’s the end of the process</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"spell-out-links\">Spell out links</h2>\n\n<p>If your message includes a website link, you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>spell out the web address (<abbr title=\"web address\">URL</abbr>) in full rather than using a descriptive link, for example <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/changeaddressdrivinglicence\">https://www.gov.uk/changeaddressdrivinglicence</a> - this helps users  know where the link is going</li>\n  <li>avoid link-shortening services as users can’t tell what the <abbr title=\"web address\">URL</abbr> links to - you&rsquo;re also dependent on an external provider to keep the link secure</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If your text message ends with a <abbr title=\"web address\">URL</abbr>, don&rsquo;t use a full stop to end the sentence. This is because it will break the link.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"use-plain-english\">Use plain English</h2>\n\n<p>Always write in plain English and follow the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk\">Government Digital Service (<abbr title=\"Government Digital Service\">GDS</abbr>) style guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This means you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>use common words and short sentences - at most 25 words per sentence</li>\n  <li>avoid using jargon or acronyms - if you have to use them, explain what they mean</li>\n  <li>address users as ‘you’ and your service team or department as ‘we’</li>\n  <li>use the active voice - for example, ‘We sent you an email’ not ‘An email was sent to you’</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"examples\">Examples</h2>\n\n<p>Use these best practice examples to see how emails and messages should be written:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"LINK TO EXAMPLE GUIDE\">Appointment confirmationXXXXXXX</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"LINK TO EXAMPLE GUIDE\">Payment reminderXXXXXX</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"LINK TO EXAMPLE GUIDE\">Application updateXXXXXX</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"LINK TO EXAMPLE GUIDE\">Payment receiptXXXXX</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"LINK TO EXAMPLE GUIDE\">Approved applicationXXXXX</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"LINK TO EXAMPLE GUIDE\">Dispatch noteXXXXX</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"related-guides\">Related guides</h2>\n\n<p>You may also find these guides useful:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"LINK TO GUIDE\">How to contact your usersXXXXXX</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"LINK TO GUIDE\">Confirmation page patternXXXXXXX</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n","header_links":[{"title":"Meeting the Digital Service Standard","href":"#meeting-the-digital-service-standard"},{"title":"Plan what you want to say","href":"#plan-what-you-want-to-say"},{"title":"Personalise your message","href":"#personalise-your-message"},{"title":"Tell users only what they need to know","href":"#tell-users-only-what-they-need-to-know"},{"title":"Give clear instructions","href":"#give-clear-instructions"},{"title":"Spell out links","href":"#spell-out-links"},{"title":"Use plain English","href":"#use-plain-english"},{"title":"Examples","href":"#examples"},{"title":"Related guides","href":"#related-guides"}],"change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2017-04-19T11:37:55Z","note":"Guidance first published"}],"change_note":"Guidance first published"},"routes":[{"type":"exact","path":"/service-manual/design/writing-email-and-text-messages-to-users"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"service-manual-publisher","rendering_app":"service-manual-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"beta","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"service_manual_guide","schema_name":"service_manual_guide","first_published_at":null,"base_path":"/service-manual/design/writing-email-and-text-messages-to-users","description":"How service teams should write emails and text message notifcations to users.","content_id":"19d4c54f-eb07-4a29-9a09-5991936635f2","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"content_owners":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/service-manual/communities/design-community","base_path":"/service-manual/communities/design-community","content_id":"9ea42648-634c-46b8-939d-948f63d227fd","description":"The design community is for anyone who wants to discuss and learn about the role of design in government.","document_type":"service_manual_guide","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-10-18T09:05:18Z","schema_name":"service_manual_guide","title":"Design community","withdrawn":false,"links":{}}],"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"OT1056","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/government-digital-service","base_path":"/government/organisations/government-digital-service","content_id":"af07d5a5-df63-4ddc-9383-6a666845ebe9","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-02-07T11:16:58Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Government Digital Service","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"cabinet-office","logo":{"formatted_title":"Government Digital Service","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}}],"service_manual_topics":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/service-manual/design","base_path":"/service-manual/design","content_id":"4b803c18-9473-4cbe-bc2e-39d269ed7063","description":"Naming your service, prototypes, frontend tools and design patterns.","document_type":"service_manual_topic","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-03-30T16:35:45Z","schema_name":"service_manual_topic","title":"Design","withdrawn":false,"links":{}}],"available_translations":[{"title":"Writing email and text messages to users","public_updated_at":null,"analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"service_manual_guide","schema_name":"service_manual_guide","base_path":"/service-manual/design/writing-email-and-text-messages-to-users","description":"How service teams should write emails and text message notifcations to users.","api_path":"/api/content/service-manual/design/writing-email-and-text-messages-to-users","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"19d4c54f-eb07-4a29-9a09-5991936635f2","locale":"en"}]},"format":"service_manual_guide","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"other","government_document_supertype":"other","payload_version":0}
