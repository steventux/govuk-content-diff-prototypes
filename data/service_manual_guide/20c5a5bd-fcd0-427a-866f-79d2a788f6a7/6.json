{"title":"Set up a team wall","public_updated_at":"2016-05-23T09:58:29Z","details":{"body":"<p>To help your service team to work in an agile way, you may want to set up a team wall.</p>\n\n<p>In agile working, team walls are a section of wall near where your team sits on which you keep a visual record of the work you’re doing.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"meeting-the-digital-service-standard\">Meeting the Digital Service Standard</h2>\n\n<p>You must show you’re working in an agile way to pass <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default#criterion-4\">point 4 (use agile methods)</a> in your <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-you-need-a-service-assessment\">service assessments</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Using walls to communicate and manage your work is one part of working in an agile way. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-team-walls-work\">How team walls work</h2>\n\n<p>You record individual pieces of work on a card or piece of paper and stick them to the wall.</p>\n\n<p>You stick other cards on the wall which represent stages of production, you can then move the pieces of work along the wall as they pass through the production stages.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-to-put-on-your-team-wall\">What to put on your team wall</h2>\n\n<p>Most teams fill the wall with paper or post-it notes and various headings, to show everything the team is working on, the stage of production it’s at, and any work that’s upcoming.</p>\n\n<p>Your wall will differ depending on the service you’re building, but most teams include details of the following on their walls:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>work your team is currently doing</li>\n  <li>work your team hasn’t started yet</li>\n  <li>work that’s done</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You should also use the wall to track:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>progress against your goals and key performance indicators (<abbr title=\"key performance indicators\">KPIs</abbr>) – for live data, you could show this on an electronic dashboard like the <a href=\"/performance\">Government Digital Service performance platform</a></li>\n  <li>any risks and issues you’ve found</li>\n  <li>major obstacles to delivery, things which are stopping you getting work done (these are sometimes called ‘blockers’)</li>\n  <li>important deadlines and dependencies</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can also display information about your service and your team, for example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>your service vision</li>\n  <li>photos or profiles of the people who are on your team</li>\n  <li>your working arrangements, eg when you have retrospectives or other meetings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-team-walls-help\">How team walls help</h2>\n\n<p>Team walls help you to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>map out problems you’re exploring</li>\n  <li>manage work you’ve agreed to do</li>\n  <li>share a lot of information quickly and publicly</li>\n  <li>put all your work together and see how it’s progressing</li>\n  <li>start conversations in your team or with others in your office, eg about your processes or points where work gets blocked</li>\n  <li>encourage communication and collaboration in your team, and with the rest of the organisation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>An up-to-date wall also allows you to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>have a physical focal point for the team to look at and comment on during standups and other meetings</li>\n  <li>promote transparency and discussion by showing everyone in your organisation the status of your work</li>\n  <li>make decisions based on an overview of your work</li>\n  <li>manage and measure workflow and spot problems that are delaying you</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p>Example: </p>\n\n<p>A team mapped out the current processes for importing and exporting goods across the UK border, which are currently handled by 26 different government departments and agencies. </p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/08/07/mapping-the-border-as-users-see-it/\">Read about what they learned from mapping the processes in their discovery</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"online-tools\">Online tools</h3>\n\n<p>As well as your team wall, you may want to record the work your team is doing online, for example using a tool like <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.trello.com\">Trello.</a> </p>\n\n<p>If you do this you should always post information about current and future work to your wall. </p>\n\n<p>If possible you can display your online tool on a screen in your work area so it is still visible to everyone.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"related-guides\">Related guides</h2>\n\n<p>Read the
