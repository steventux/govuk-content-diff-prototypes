Your service should always be based on user needs and what’s essential to help users to achieve a specific goal.</p>\n\n<p>You should think about the tasks and project goals you’ll include in the service. These might vary depending on whether it’s:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>new</li>\n  <li>connected to other services</li>\n  <li>part of a bigger service</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"meeting-the-digital-service-standard\">Meeting the Digital Service Standard</h2>\n\n<p>You must scope your service as part of meeting these points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/service-manual/service-standard/understand-user-needs\">point 1 - understand user needs</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/service-manual/service-standard/do-ongoing-user-research\">point 2 - do ongoing user research</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/service-manual/service-standard/use-agile-methods\">point 4 - use agile methods</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/service-manual/service-standard/iterate-and-improve-frequently\">point 5 - iterate and improve frequently</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You’ll have to explain how you did this in your <a href=\"/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-you-need-a-service-assessment\">service assessments</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-you-should-scope-your-service\">Why you should scope your service</h2>\n\n<p>Knowing the scope of the service will help you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>decide what your team needs to improve or build</li>\n  <li>plan what your team can do in a defined time and within the project budget</li>\n  <li>agree with others what work you won’t do - known as what’s ‘out of scope’</li>\n  <li>avoid unnecessary or added work - known as ‘scope creep’</li>\n  <li>iterate your scope based on evidence of users’ needs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"when-to-scope-your-service\">When to scope your service</h2>\n\n<p>You should scope your service during discovery, before you start planning, designing or building anything. Find out <a href=\"/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-work\">how the discovery phase works</a>.</p>\n\n<p>By the final week of discovery you should be able to define a scope for your service.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-scope-your-service\">How to scope your service</h2>\n\n<p>Start by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2016/04/21/how-to-make-a-user-journey-map\">mapping the user journey</a> of people who want to do the task your service provides.</p>\n\n<p>This will help you understand the end-to-end service and identify all the ways that users interact with it (including all tools, transactions, support and offline steps).</p>\n\n<p>You can also learn more about your users and what they need from your service by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>reviewing existing evidence (for example, analytics, search logs and call centre data)</li>\n  <li>interviewing users</li>\n  <li>talking to people in your organisation who deal with users</li>\n  <li>talking to third parties who manage or deliver any aspect of the existing service</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Scoping your service should give a better understanding of what task users are trying to complete and how your service can help them do this.</p>\n\n<p>Read the guide on <a href=\"/service-manual/design/naming-your-service\">Naming your service</a> to help you understand your scope.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"changing-your-scope\">Changing your scope</h2>\n\n<p>Your service scope might change during a project due to work you do, like user research and data analysis, or things you can’t control, like policy changes.</p>\n\n<p>You can change your scope if you have evidence it’ll create a better service for users. If you do change the scope, consider whether this risks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>delaying delivery</li>\n  <li>increasing cost</li>\n  <li>reducing quality</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"related-guides\">Related guides</h2>\n\n<p>You may also find these guides useful:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/service-manual/design/introduction-designing-government-services\">Introduction: designing government services</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/service-manual/user-research/user-research-in-discovery\">User research in discovery</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/service-manual/the-team\">The team</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/service-manual/agile-delivery\">Agile delivery</a></li>\n</ul>\n","header_links":[{"title":"Meeting the Digital Service Standard","href":"#meeting-the-digital-service-standard"},{"title":"Why you should scope your service","href":"#why-you-should-scope-your-service"},{"title":"When to scope your service","href":"#when-to-scope-your-service"},{"title":"How to scope your service","href":"#how-to-scope-your-service"},{"title":"Changing your scope","href":"#changing-your-scope"},{"title":"Related guides","href":"#related-guides"}],"change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2016-12-09T11:34:33Z","note":"Guidance first published","reason_for_change":""}],"change_note":"Guidance first published"},"routes":[{"type":"exact","path":"/service-manual/design/scoping-your-service"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"service-manual-publisher","rendering_app":"service-manual-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"beta","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"service_manual_guide","schema_name":"service_manual_guide","first_published_at":"2016-12-09T11:36:37Z","base_path":"/service-manual/design/scoping-your-service","description":"Scope your service to identify what it currently does, what you should build, and set goals, deadlines and costs.","content_id":"fccaba01-b931-477f-8644-f96647a4e0a3","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"content_owners":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/service-manual/communities/design-community","base_path":"/service-manual/communities/design-community","content_id":"9ea42648-634c-46b8-939d-948f63d227fd","description":"The design community is for anyone who wants to discuss and learn about the role of design in government.","document_type":"service_manual_guide","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-10-18T09:05:18Z","schema_name":"service_manual_guide","title":"Design community","withdrawn":false,"links":{}}],"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"OT1056","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/government-digital-service","base_path":"/government/organisations/government-digital-service","content_id":"af07d5a5-df63-4ddc-9383-6a666845ebe9","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-02-07T11:16:58Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Government Digital Service","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"cabinet-office","logo":{"formatted_title":"Government Digital Service","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}}],"service_manual_topics":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/service-manual/design","base_path":"/service-manual/design","content_id":"4b803c18-9473-4cbe-bc2e-39d269ed7063","description":"Naming your service, prototypes, frontend tools and design patterns.","document_type":"service_manual_topic","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-03-30T16:35:45Z","schema_name":"service_manual_topic","title":"Design","withdrawn":false,"links":{}}],"available_translations":[{"title":"Scoping your service","public_updated_at":"2016-12-09T11:36:37Z","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"service_manual_guide","schema_name":"service_manual_guide","base_path":"/service-manual/design/scoping-your-service","description":"Scope your service to identify what it currently does, what you should build, and set goals, deadlines and costs.","api_path":"/api/content/service-manual/design/scoping-your-service","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"fccaba01-b931-477f-8644-f96647a4e0a3","locale":"en"}]},"format":"service_manual_guide","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"other","government_document_supertype":"other","payload_version":0}
