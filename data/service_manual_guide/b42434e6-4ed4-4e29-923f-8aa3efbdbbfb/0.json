The number of users without access to email will differ from service to service.</p>\n\n<p>You should do research to understand this group and have a plan for helping them to use your service.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"user-generated-usernames\">User-generated usernames</h2>\n\n<p>You should only ask users to create their own usernames if your service contains user-generated content that requires attributing. For example, a blog with comments.</p>\n\n<p>User-generated usernames are harder to create and easier to forget than email addresses.</p>\n\n<p>You need to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>tell people whether their proposed username is unique</li>\n  <li>suggest unique ones for them, in some cases</li>\n  <li>make sure people can retrieve or reset their username</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2

id=\"service-generated-tokens\">Service-generated tokens</h2>\n\n<p>If users are unlikely to access your service more than once, it may be easier to give them a unique reference instead of forcing them to create a username.</p>\n\n<p>Unique references are hard to remember so you should email or SMS them to the user.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"discuss-usernames\">Discuss usernames</h2>\n\n<p><a
