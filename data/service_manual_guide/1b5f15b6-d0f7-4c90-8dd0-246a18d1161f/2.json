{"title":"Agile methodologies explained","public_updated_at":"2016-05-23T09:59:26Z","details":{"body":"<p>Agile ways of working include a number of different methodologies, eg Scrum and Kanban. Use whichever methodologies meet the needs of your team.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"meeting-the-digital-service-standard\">Meeting the Digital Service Standard</h2>\n\n<p>To pass <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default#criterion-4\">point 4 (use agile methods)</a> in your <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default/assessments-at-gds.html\">service assessments</a>, you must show how your team is using agile methods to build and run your service.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"agile-terminology\">Agile terminology</h2>\n\n<p>Each methodology has developed its own terminology (or jargon) to describe the tools and techniques it uses. Similar methods may have different names so it’s more important to understand and follow the agile objective of the method, whatever it’s called.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scrum\">Scrum</h3>\n\n<p>Scrum is the most commonly used framework in agile. It provides a highly structured model with clearly defined roles and responsibilities, which can appeal to traditionally structured organisations who are moving to agile.</p>\n\n<p>Detailed guidance on the features of Scrum can be found in the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html\">Scrum Guide</a>, written by the developers of Scrum, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kanban\">Kanban</h3>\n\n<p>Kanban (as a development methodology) was inspired by production systems, like those developed by Toyota, that focus on reducing waste and improving quality.</p>\n\n<p>Kanban focuses on visualising and then improving your current working practices and processes in order to help work flow continuously, quickly and smoothly through your system. A fast, smooth flow of work through your system means you can deliver value quickly and predictably, and can get early feedback to know if you’re providing a product or service that meets your users’ needs.</p>\n\n<p>Read more about Kanban in <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/\">A brief introduction to Kanban</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.djaa.com/principles-kanban-method-0\">The Principles of the Kanban Method.</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lean\">Lean</h3>\n\n<p>Lean software development, like Kanban, is adapted from lean manufacturing principles such as the Toyota Production System. The principles behind lean software development focus teams on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>reducing waste</li>\n  <li>delivering quickly</li>\n  <li>learning and improving</li>\n  <li>using evidence and data to make decisions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Read more about Lean in <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.poppendieck.com/\">The Lean Mindset</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theleanstartup.com/\">The Lean Startup.</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-and-when-to-use-scrum-kanban-and-lean\">Why and when to use Scrum, Kanban and Lean</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"scrum-1\">Scrum</h3>\n\n<p>Scrum is a good starting point for teams new to agile working. Teams generally find Scrum most useful when they are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>building a new product or service</li>\n  <li>enhancing existing features</li>\n  <li>adding new features in each sprint (a timeboxed period)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When you’re running your live service and have potentially urgent requests you may find sprints constraining. At this stage you may want to move to flow-based working like Kanban. But you can still keep using many of the activities associated with Scrum, like daily stand-ups, retrospectives and regular reviews of progress.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kanban-1\">Kanban</h3>\n\n<p>Kanban is ideal for teams that want or need to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>understand where the bottlenecks are in their processes</li>\n  <li>control the amount of work they’re doing</li>\n  <li>predict their output based on actual delivery</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It’s particularly useful when teams need to react quickly to changing priorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lean-1\">Lean</h3>\n\n<p>Lean provides specific practices and tools that allow teams to focus on learning as quickly as possible. These practices are particularly useful when teams are first discovering what their users’ needs are and when making significant decisions about how to address those user needs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"related-guides\">Related guides</h2>\n\n<p>Read the following guides to find out more about working in an agile way:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/service-manual/agile-delivery/agile-government-services-introduction\">agile and government services: an introduction</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/service-manual/agile-delivery/core-principles-agile\">core principles of agile</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/service-manual/agile-delivery/agile-tools-techniques\">agile tools and techniques</a></li>\n</ul>\n","header_links":[{"title":"Meeting the Digital Service Standard","href":"#meeting-the-digital-service-standard"},{"title":"Agile terminology","href":"#agile-terminology"},{"title":"Why and when to use Scrum, Kanban and Lean","href":"#why-and-when-to-use-scrum-kanban-and-lean"},{"title":"Related guides","href":"#related-guides"}]},"routes":[{"type":"exact","path":"/service-manual/agile-delivery/agile-methodologies"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"service-manual-publisher","rendering_app":"service-manual-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"beta","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"service_manual_guide","schema_name":"service_manual_guide","first_published_at":"2016-02-29T09:24:10Z","base_path":"/service-manual/agile-delivery/agile-methodologies","description":"Within agile there are a number of different methodologies you can follow.
