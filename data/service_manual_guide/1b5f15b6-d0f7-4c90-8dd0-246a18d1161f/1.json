(a fixed period of time)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When you’re running your live service and have urgent requests you may find sprints constraining and want to move to a flow-based method like Kanban.</p>\n\n<p>But you can still keep using many of the activities associated with Scrum, like daily stand-up meetings, retrospectives and regular reviews of progress.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kanban-1\">Kanban</h3>\n\n<p>Kanban helps your team to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>find the bottlenecks in your processes</li>\n  <li>control the amount of work you&rsquo;re doing</li>\n  <li>predict your output based on actual delivery</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It’s particularly useful if at times when your team needs to react quickly to changing priorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lean-1\">Lean</h3>\n\n<p>Lean allows your team to focus on learning as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Lean&rsquo;s tools and techniques are particularly useful when your team is first discovering what your users’ needs are and deciding how to address those needs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"related-guides\">Related guides</h2>\n\n<p>You may also find these guides useful:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"/service-manual/agile-delivery/agile-government-services-introduction\">Agile and government services: an introduction</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/service-manual/agile-delivery/core-principles-agile\">Core principles of agile</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"/service-manual/agile-delivery/agile-tools-techniques\">Agile tools and techniques</a></li>\n</ul>\n","header_links":[{"title":"Meeting the Digital Service Standard","href":"#meeting-the-digital-service-standard"},{"title":"Popular agile methods explained","href":"#popular-agile-methods-explained"},{"title":"Working with multiple agile methods","href":"#working-with-multiple-agile-methods"},{"title":"Deciding which methods to work with","href":"#deciding-which-methods-to-work-with"},{"title":"Related guides","href":"#related-guides"}],"change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2016-08-10T16:06:12Z","note":"Iteration based on SME feedback","reason_for_change":"https://groups.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/forum/#!msg/serviceowners/bFR139NbzNA/rtyB_L1jAQAJ\r\n\r\nAdam Maddison has asked for changes to this guide.
