He will be joined by Andrew-Corbett Jones, head of Sydney’s Tyro FinTech Hub and Andrew Humphries, co-founder of The Bakery, a startup accelerator in London.</p>\n\n<p>Nick McInnes, Director General, UK Department for International Trade Australia and New Zealand, said:\n“The Startup Games provide a fantastic opportunity to gain exposure and learn from top Australasian mentors and investors, as well as discover more about growing your business in the UK, with advice from local and visiting experts.</p>\n\n<p>“The UK offers a very friendly environment for Australian startups looking to grow their business internationally. Some of the reasons why startups should consider the UK include low tax rates, access to finance and world-class hubs and accelerators.”</p>\n\n<p>The Games are supported by the UK’s Global Entrepreneur Programme, which works with overseas entrepreneurs with the potential for rapid growth to base all or part of their company in the UK.  The programme’s network of 22 UK and overseas based “Dealmakers”, successful entrepreneurs, VCs and angel investors in their own right, provide mentoring and support to firms for whom scaling up in the UK is the right next step in their company’s journey.</p>\n\n<p>Founders and co-founders of early-stage Australian and New Zealand startup companies are encouraged to fill in an application via <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.events.trade.gov.uk/start-up-games-sydney/apply-here/\">the website</a> (including a summary business plan).
