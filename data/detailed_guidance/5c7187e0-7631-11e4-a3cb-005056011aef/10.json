It is important that you research both sides of the transaction.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, see the guides on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-goods-from-the-eu-to-a-third-country-outside-the-eu\">exporting your goods from the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> to a third country</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/dispatching-your-goods-within-the-eu\">dispatching your goods within the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr></a>.</p>\n\n<p>First, you need to classify your goods. Use of standardised classification codes in the Integrated Tariff of the United Kingdom (the Tariff) makes it easier to check if any restrictions or charges apply.</p>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/trade-tariff\">find commodity codes and other measures applying to imports and exports by accessing the free online UK Trade Tariff</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Remember that in general it is much simpler to trade with other <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> countries than with countries outside the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr>. This is because the goods are in free circulation. The <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> is a single market and the UK is in a Customs Union, allowing trade with other <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> countries without restriction (although some local charges may still apply).</p>\n\n<p>If you export nuclear products, you must comply with strict regulations. Likewise, if you handle any oil or gas products, you’ll also have to comply with certain regulations. For more details, see the guide on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/oil-gas-refining-and-petrochemicals\">oil, gas, refining and petrochemicals</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"export-licensing-and-certification\">Export licensing and certification</h3>\n\n<p>An export licence is required to export specified goods with military uses. The list of goods requiring a licence does not include any energy or power products, although you may require a licence for goods with a potential military use, eg components for use in nuclear production. In addition, similar licensing rules apply when brokering the sale of certain Dual-Use Goods that could be used for military purposes and in particular for weapons of mass destruction. For more information, you can see the page on export licences for military and Dual-Use Goods in the guide on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/aerospace-and-defence-import-and-export-regulations\">aerospace and defence</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/eco/docs/dual-use-brokering.pdf\">download guidance on brokering Dual-Use Goods from the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills (<abbr title=\"Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills\">BIS</abbr>) website (PDF, 168K)</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/export-control-organisation/eco-training-skills-academy/eco-films\">Watch a video about your export control responsibilities and how you can ensure you have the correct licences on the <abbr title=\"Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills\">BIS</abbr> website</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"trading-in-nuclear-energy\">Trading in nuclear energy</h2>\n\n<p>If you handle nuclear energy or dual-use products, you’ll have to comply with strict regulations.</p>\n\n<p>Nuclear materials include: Uranium Ore concentrates, Plutonium, Uranium 233, Uranium enriched in the isotopes 233 or 235, natural Uranium and mixtures, compounds and alloys containing any of the foregoing, including spent or irradiated nuclear reactor fuel elements (cartridges).</p>\n\n<p>Products that have a civil and military application are defined as ‘dual-use’. The Community General Export Authorisation governs some of these products to certain countries. See the guide on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/controls-on-dual-use-goods\">controls on Dual-Use Goods</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"export-restrictions\">Export restrictions</h3>\n\n<p>If you intend to export certain types of sensitive nuclear equipment, some of these may appear on what is called the ‘trigger list’. The Export Control Organisation (<abbr title=\"Export Control Organisation\">ECO</abbr>) assesses these applications and sets out the important factors to bear in mind when you apply for a licence. To find information about the trigger list, see the guide the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-of-nuclear-equipment-material-and-technology-trigger-list-requirements\">export of nuclear equipment, material and technology - ‘Trigger List’ requirements</a>. For detailed information on the various aspects of controlled goods, see the guides on the Export Control Organisation and key licensing guidance.</p>\n\n<p>You can subscribe to receive <abbr title=\"Export Control Organisation\">ECO</abbr> Notices to Exporters by email. To apply, email the <abbr title=\"Export Control Organisation\">ECO</abbr> at <a href=\"mailto:web.comments@bis.gsi.gov.uk\">web.comments@bis.gsi.gov.uk</a> - and include your name, your company or organisation name, email address and telephone number.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"import-restrictions\">Import restrictions</h3>\n\n<p>Nuclear materials may not be imported under the Open General Import Licence unless consigned from a member state of the European Community (<abbr title=\"European Community\">EC</abbr>). Imports of such materials from third countries will therefore require individual import licences from the Health &amp; Safety Executive’s (<abbr title=\"Health &amp; Safety Executive\">HSE</abbr>) Office for Civil Nuclear Security (<abbr title=\"Office for Civil Nuclear Security\">OCNS</abbr>). You can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/ocns/ocnsil.pdf\">download an application form to import nuclear materials from the <abbr title=\"Health &amp; Safety Executive\">HSE</abbr> website (PDF, 161 KB)</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p>For the latest news on banned and restricted goods, or changes in licensing requirements, you should <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/trade-policy-unit/importing-into-uk/notices-to-importers\">refer to the notices to importers on the <abbr title=\"Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills\">BIS</abbr> website</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"health-safety-and-environment\">Health, safety and environment</h3>\n\n<p>Health and safety is of great importance when you’re handling any kind of nuclear-related products. In the UK, nuclear safety issues are the responsibility of the <abbr title=\"Health &amp; Safety Executive\">HSE</abbr>. The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate is part of the <abbr title=\"Health &amp; Safety Executive\">HSE</abbr> and regulates nuclear safety. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/index.htm\">Read an overview of nuclear health and safety on the <abbr title=\"Health &amp; Safety Executive\">HSE</abbr> website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Health &amp; Safety Executive\">HSE</abbr> also governs the import of certain carcinogenic substances - including goat hair and other types of animal hair which may, for example, carry anthrax - by prohibiting or placing conditions on import from certain countries.</p>\n\n<p>If you keep, use, accumulate and/or dispose of radioactive substances, you are likely to need an environmental permit.</p>\n\n<p>Special requirements also apply to the transportation of nuclear materials. If you have an enquiry related to such movement, you can call the <abbr title=\"Office for Civil Nuclear Security\">OCNS</abbr> Transport Security Inspectorate on Tel 01235 432952.</p>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p>You can use this site to find details and apply to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/get-an-environmental-permit\">get an environmental permit</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"researching-your-export-destination-in-the-energy-and-power-sector\">Researching your export destination in the energy and power sector</h2>\n\n<p>As a starting point you may wish to seek advice from UK Trade &amp; Investment (<abbr title=\"UK Trade and Investment\">UKTI</abbr>). <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ukti.gov.uk/export/unitedkingdom/contactus.html\">Find your local international trade team on the <abbr title=\"UK Trade and Investment\">UKTI</abbr> website</a>.

Your goods may need to be adapted to comply with these. Rules in your export market may be less or more strict than in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>For an overview of market information on sectors and countries, see the guide on researching and entering overseas markets.</p>\n\n<p>You can ask for information about your export destination country from a range of organisations, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>your local <abbr title=\"UK Trade and Investment\">UKTI</abbr> trade team</li>\n  <li>your <abbr title=\"UK Trade and Investment\">UKTI</abbr> team within the commercial section of the UK embassy in your destination country</li>\n  <li>energy and power sector trade associations</li>\n  <li>the Chambers of Commerce in the UK and in your destination country</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ukti.gov.uk/investintheuk/whytheuk/localisation/107406.html\">read about partnership programmes offering business support to the automotive sector on the UK Trade &amp; Investment website</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"tariffs-and-duties-in-the-energy-and-power-sector\">Tariffs and duties in the energy and power sector</h2>\n\n<p>All businesses in this sector must comply with a range of import-specific regulations.
