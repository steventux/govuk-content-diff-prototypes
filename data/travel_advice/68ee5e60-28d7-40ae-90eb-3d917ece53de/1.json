Political protests can occur in Lomé, sometimes at very short notice, and may occasionally become violent. There have been clashes in Lomé, most recently in November 2014 when there were some injuries as police broke up a confrontation between government and opposition supporters. You should avoid all large public gatherings.  \r\n\r\n###Crime \r\n \r\nViolent crime, theft and pick-pocketing are common throughout Togo and you should be especially cautious in Lomé along the beach and in the markets. Attacks occur during daylight as well as at night. You should avoid travelling alone where possible, even within Lomé city limits, especially at night. You should be alert to the risk of car-jackings, including through staged accidents. It’s generally better not to resist armed attack.\r\n\r\n###Scams\r\n\r\nBritish nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists operating in West Africa. The scams come in many forms: romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities and can pose great financial risk to victims. You should treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa.\r\n\r\n   \r\n###Local travel \r\n\r\nExit and entry points at borders can be opened and closed at short notice. Be prepared for checks by the local police and military.\r\n\r\n###Road travel\r\n\r\nDriving standards and road conditions in Togo are poor. Avoid travelling outside towns and cities at night as roads are poorly lit.During the rainy season minor, unpaved roads may become impassable. You should stop at all control points on request, turn on interior vehicle lights and only continue when permission has been given to do so. You may encounter official and unofficial roadblocks even in the city centre.\r\n    \r\nTake care when using public transport; driving standards and vehicle maintenance are poor.\r\n    \r\n\r\n###Sea travel  \r\n\r\nThere have been incidents of piracy and armed robbery against large vessels in Togolese waters and those of neighbouring countries. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.\r\n\r\n###Swimming\r\n \r\nAvoid swimming in the sea as ocean currents are very strong along the coast. Many drownings occur each year. \r\n\r\n###Consular assistance \r\n\r\nThe number of British visitors to Togo is low. The main type of incident for which British nationals need consular assistance in Togo is replacing lost and stolen passports. You should carry a photocopy of your passport at all times and keep  your passport in a safe place.\r\n \r\nThere’s no British embassy in Togo.
