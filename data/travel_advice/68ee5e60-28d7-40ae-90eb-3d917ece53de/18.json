You should avoid all large public gatherings.  \r\n\r\n###Crime \r\n \r\nViolent crime, theft and pick-pocketing are common throughout Togo and you should be especially cautious in Lomé along the beach and in the markets. Attacks occur during daylight as well as at night. You should avoid travelling alone where possible, even within Lomé city limits, especially at night. You should be alert to the risk of car-jackings, including through staged accidents. It’s generally better not to resist armed attack.\r\n\r\n###Scams\r\n\r\nBritish nationals are increasingly being targeted by scam artists operating in West Africa. The scams come in many forms: romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities and can pose great financial risk to victims. You should treat with considerable caution any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet who lives in West Africa.\r\n\r\n   \r\n###Local travel \r\n\r\nExit and entry points at borders can be opened and closed at short notice. Be prepared for checks by the local police and military.\r\n\r\n###Road travel\r\n\r\nDriving standards and road conditions in Togo can be poor. Avoid travelling outside towns and cities at night as roads are poorly lit.During the rainy season minor, unpaved roads may become impassable. You should stop at all control points on request, turn on interior vehicle lights and only continue when permission has been given to do so.

Mariners should take appropriate precautions.\r\n\r\n###Swimming\r\n \r\nYou should take care if you decide to swim in the  sea as ocean currents are very strong along the coast. There have been a number of drownings each year.\r\n\r\n###Consular assistance \r\n\r\nThe number of British visitors to Togo is low.
