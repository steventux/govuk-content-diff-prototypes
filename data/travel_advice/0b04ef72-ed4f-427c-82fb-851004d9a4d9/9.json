Your safety is our main concern, but we can’t provide tailored advice for individual trips. If you’re concerned about whether or not it’s safe for you to travel, you should read the travel advice for the country or territory you’re travelling to, together with information from other sources you’ve identified, before making your own decision on whether to travel. Only you can decide whether it’s safe for you to travel.  \r\n\r\nWhen we judge the level of risk to British nationals in a particular place has become unacceptably high, we’ll state on the travel advice page for that country or territory that we advise against all or all but essential travel.

Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can’t offer a refund to their customers.\r\n\r\nFor more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit [the Citizen’s Advice Bureau website](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/).

For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you’re not happy with their response, you can complain to the [Financial Ombudsman Service](http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm). \r\n\r\n###Registering your travel details with us\r\n\r\nWe’re no longer asking people to register with us before travel.
