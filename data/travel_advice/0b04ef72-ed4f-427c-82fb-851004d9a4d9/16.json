Safeguard passports, money and other valuables. Be vigilant when exchanging money and using ATMs, and avoid carrying large amounts of cash. Use the hotel’s own safe if possible.\r\n\r\nThere have been instances of pick-pocketing on bus routes, especially the 12 and 13 routes between Valletta and St Julian’s. Thieves are targeting crowded afternoon buses. Be vigilant and keep sight of valuables at all times. Local police are aware of the problem and conducting investigations.\r\n\r\nPersonal attacks, including rape and sexual assault, are rare but do occur. Avoid splitting up from your friends and don’t go off with people you don’t know. If you drink, take sensible precautions including buying your own drinks and keeping sight of them at all times.\r\n\r\n###Hunting season\r\n\r\nBird hunting is practised during the spring and autumn. Dates are movable and determined by the government in the lead up to the season. Local print and online news media normally carry the start and end dates, and times of when hunting is allowed. \r\n\r\nHunting with firearms is common and is normally allowed from 2 hours before sunrise until 2 hours after sunset.  Hunting areas are rarely marked and can overlap with camping areas, country walkways and other public areas. Although not common, incidents involving members of the public have occurred previously. Be aware of your surroundings when visiting rural areas and nature spots during the hunting seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Scams  \r\n\r\nBritish and Maltese nationals are increasingly being targeted by [scam artists operating globally](http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/). The [scams come in many forms](http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/) (romance and friendship, business ventures, work and employment opportunities) and can pose great financial risk to victims. Be very cautious about any requests for funds, a job offer, a business venture or a face to face meeting from someone you have been in correspondence with over the internet. \r\n\r\n###Local travel\r\n\r\nThe political situation in Libya has resulted in tensions between two offices claiming to represent the Libyan government in Malta. The two buildings are situated near bus stops on Triq L-Abate Rigord in Ta’ Xbiex and Triq L-Imdina in Attard. Take extra care and avoid  large gatherings and demonstrations at these locations.\r\n\r\n###Road travel  \r\nYou can drive in Malta using your UK driving licence.\r\n\r\nTake care while driving as some roads are in poor condition. Keep to the speed limit. Local standards of driving are poor.\r\n\r\nIn 2014 there were 10 road deaths in Malta (source: National Statistics Office Malta). This equates to 2.4 road deaths per 100,000 of population and compares to the UK average of 2.7 road deaths per 100,000 of population in 2014.

You should make sure you understand the system and follow any warnings; red flags indicate dangerous or hazardous conditions. You should swim within designated swimming zones and take extra care if there are no life-guards, flags or signs. Follow local advice if jellyfish are present.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information and a general code of conduct for beaches in Malta on the [Malta Tourism Authority website](http://www.visitmalta.com/en/beach-conduct).\r\n"},{"content_type":"text/html","content":"<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n<p>Crime against tourists is rare although robberies, handbag snatching, pick-pocketing and theft from parked cars can occur.
