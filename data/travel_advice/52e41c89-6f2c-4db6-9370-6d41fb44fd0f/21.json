One of the attackers was killed and the other was injured and arrested.\r\n\r\nOver 900,000 British nationals visit Egypt every year. Most visits are trouble-free.\r\n\r\nOn 31 October 2015, a flight from Sharm el Sheikh to St Petersburg crashed in North Sinai. Egyptian and Russian authorities are conducting an investigation. The investigation has not yet formally concluded, but on 17 November Russian authorities stated that the crash was caused by an explosive device onboard the flight. As a precautionary measure, we are advising against all but essential travel by air to or from Sharm el Sheikh.\r\n\r\nWe are not raising the threat level in the resort. The above advice applies only to air travel to and from Sharm el Sheikh. \r\n\r\nRegular flights to and from the UK to Sharm el Sheikh were suspended on 4 November. Special security measures to allow travellers in Sharm el Sheikh to return to the UK by air safely ended on Tuesday 17 November. UK airlines are no longer operating flights from Sharm el Sheikh to the UK. \r\n\r\nIf you’re still in Sharm el Sheikh and now wish to leave you’ll need to make your own arrangements for returning to the UK. \r\n\r\nThis may involve having to travel with an airline to which extra security measures eg separate baggage flights, don’t apply. You should make your own decisions about the risk based on the information in our travel advice.\r\n\r\nWe will continue working with the Egyptian Authorities to enable regular flights between the UK and Sharm el Sheikh to resume. We are also liaising with travel companies so that they are able to resume flights and holidays in Sharm el Sheikh as soon as appropriate security arrangements are in place.\r\n\r\n**Terrorism**\r\n\r\nTerrorists continue to plan and conduct attacks in Egypt. Further attacks are likely. Since 2013, attacks have mainly targeted the security forces, their facilities and other government buildings. You should take great care near these places. Attacks could be indiscriminate and may occur without prior warning. Foreigners have also been targeted. There have been threats to western nationals, institutions, and businesses posted on websites and social media. \r\n\r\nThere is a threat of kidnapping, particularly in remote desert areas. On 22 July 2015, a foreign national was kidnapped in the western desert. He was murdered in August 2015. A terrorist group has claimed responsibility for his murder. \r\n\r\nThe FCO is constantly reviewing the threat to British nationals from international terrorism and will reflect any credible threats in this travel advice. See [Terrorism](/foreign-travel-advice/egypt/terrorism)\r\n\r\n**Sharm el Sheikh and Hurghada** \r\n\r\nEnhanced security measures are in place to protect the Sharm el Sheikh and Hurghada resort areas. Security forces are situated at the international airports, at check points around the perimeter of the towns and throughout the Governorates. Routine security checks are being performed on entry into the airport and the police are carrying out vehicle checks in the towns. \r\n\r\n**Protests and demonstrations**\r\n\r\n25 January 2016 marks the fifth anniversary of the start of the 2011 revolution. The period around the anniversary has seen demonstrations each year since 2011, some of which have turned violent. In 2014 there were terrorist attacks in Cairo and elsewhere in the country. There is a risk of violence again this year, and you should avoid all demonstrations.\r\n\r\nProtests, marches and demonstrations can occur across Egypt, often on Fridays, but also at other times and with little prior notice. British and foreign nationals have been arrested during demonstrations. The atmosphere at demonstrations can change quickly and without warning. Police may use water cannon, tear gas, birdshot or live ammunition for crowd control. \r\n\r\nIf you become aware of any nearby protests, leave the area immediately. Make sure you keep valid photographic identification with you at all times. Westerners, including British Nationals, have been killed, raped and sexually assaulted at demonstrations.

Stay away from demonstrations and large gatherings of people. If you become aware of any nearby protests, leave the area immediately. \r\n \r\n###Crime \r\n\r\nThe crime rate in Egypt is generally low, but over the years expatriates have sometimes suffered armed robberies, muggings, sexual assaults, rapes, break-ins to accommodation and cars, and car-jackings at gun and knife-point have taken place in areas popular with expatriates, including during the daytime. Car-jackings generally target four-wheel drive vehicles. Muggings have occurred in taxis. \r\n\r\nIn 2014, the British Embassy responded to 21 cases of rape and sexual assault against British nationals in Egypt. Some assaults were against children. Many occurred in what were considered to be safe places, like hotels. Assaults have occurred in taxis and on microbuses. If you are travelling on a microbus, avoid being the last passenger left on the bus. Women should take extra care when travelling alone.\r\n\r\nTake care of your passport and valuables. Use hotel safes and beware of pickpockets and bag snatchers.\r\n\r\nIf you are the victim of any crime you must report it to the tourist police immediately. Failure to report crimes before you leave Egypt will make it impossible to seek a prosecution at a later date.\r\n \r\n###North Sinai \r\n\r\nThe FCO advise against all travel to the Governorate of North Sinai. The Egyptian armed forces are conducting military operations against extremist groups in this area. \r\n\r\nThere are regular bomb attacks against government buildings, security forces and energy infrastructure. The al-Arish area has seen many attacks, but the whole of the North Sinai region is at risk. \r\n\r\nOn 1 July, a series of attacks against military targets around Sheikh Zuwayed in North Sinai killed a number of Egyptian soldiers. \r\n\r\nA state of emergency has been declared and a curfew is in place between 7pm and 6am along the coast between al-Arish and Rafah extending around 40km inland.\r\n\r\nFor the latest requirements on crossing from Egypt to Gaza, delivering aid or entering for humanitarian purposes, you should contact the Egyptian Embassy in London. However, the Egyptian authorities have stated that all aid going into Gaza from Egypt must be channelled through the Egyptian Red Crescent (telephone: + 20 226 703 979, + 20 226 703 983, fax: + 20 226 703 967). Short notice requests for humanitarian access and those made in Egypt are unlikely to be considered. The Egyptian authorities can ask for a letter from the British Embassy in Cairo as part of their entry requirements. The British Embassy considers each request carefully and is only able to provide letters in certain circumstances and against strict criteria when entry is for humanitarian aid purposes. Contact the British Embassy directly for details. You should also read the FCO Travel Advice for Israel and the Occupied Territories.\r\n\r\nForeign workers have been taken hostage by Bedouin tribesmen.\r\n\r\nSecurity authorities often close the Suez-Taba road.\r\n \r\n###South Sinai\r\n \r\nThe FCO advise against all but essential travel to the Governorate of South Sinai, with the exception of the area within the Sharm el Sheikh perimeter barrier, which includes the airport and the areas of Sharm el Maya, Hadaba, Naama Bay, Sharks Bay and Nabq. Enhanced security measures are in place to protect the resort areas. \r\n\r\nIn October 2013 and May 2014, there were bomb blasts in El Tor (Al Tur) in South Sinai which targeted a security forces building, police checkpoints and a passenger bus on the road south of El Tor. There were a number of deaths and injuries.\r\n\r\nIn February 2014, 3 South Korean tourists and their driver were killed in an attack on a bus in Taba (Sinai).\r\n\r\n###Hurghada\r\nEnhanced security measures are in place to protect the resort areas.\r\n\r\n###Cairo \r\nThere’s a risk that tourists at high profile sites like the Giza Pyramids may be confronted aggressively for money or business, even while travelling by car, or taxi. Visitors using a pre-booked guide, or taking an organised tour to visit the Giza Pyramids are likely to face fewer difficulties.\r\n\r\nThere have been a number of attacks in Cairo mainly targeting government and security targets.\r\n\r\n###Nile Delta\r\nPolitical protests are common in many Delta towns and many Delta towns have also seen attacks against security forces buildings and personnel. These attacks often happen at security checkpoints. \r\n\r\n###Western Desert\r\n \r\nExercise extreme caution in all border areas.\r\n\r\nThe FCO advise against all but essential travel to the area west of the Nile Valley and Nile Delta regions, excluding the coastal areas between the Nile Delta and Marsa Matruh (as shown on the map) The area to which the FCO advise against all but essential travel does not include many of the tourist areas along the Nile river (eg Luxor, Qina, Aswan, Abu Simbel and the Valley of the Kings).\r\n\r\nYou’ll need a permit from the Travel Permits Department of the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior if you travel to the south west corner of Egypt near the border with Sudan or Libya. You should carefully consider your security arrangements; the border areas are porous, and bandits and armed groups operate. In July 2014, an armed group attacked a security checkpoint along the Farafra-Bawati road in the New Valley Governorate, killing 22 border guards.  In September 2015 Egyptian security forces mistakenly killed 12 Egyptian and Mexican members of a tour group in the western desert area of Al-Wahat. \r\n  \r\n###Road travel\r\n \r\nAccidents are common, mainly due to poor road conditions, dangerous driving and non-enforcement of traffic laws. The UN estimates that road accidents killed almost 16,000 people in Egypt in 2011. This is more than eight times the number in the UK. Observe the speed limit and if possible avoid independent road travel outside main cities and resorts at night. Make sure you have adequate insurance.\r\n \r\nYou can drive in Egypt on an International driving permit for up to six months. If you intend to remain in Egypt for a longer period you must apply for an Egyptian driving licence.\r\n \r\nBy law, seatbelts must be worn when travelling in the front of a vehicle. \r\n \r\nIf you are travelling off road, employ a qualified guide and obtain appropriate permits from the Ministry of Interior. \r\n \r\nOnly certain categories of foreign residents may import vehicles. Vehicles of visitors should be temporarily imported with a valid \"carnet de passage\" available from the Automobile Association.\r\n \r\nThere have been a number of serious bus crashes in recent years with large numbers of fatalities, including tourists.\r\n \r\n###Rail travel\r\n \r\nThere have been a number of fatal accidents in recent years. Suspect devices have been found at train stations and on the rail network. Although several of these have been hoaxes or false alarms, you should remain vigilant, and take into account the possibility of delay or disruption to rail services, especially on the Cairo-Alexandria line.\r\n \r\n###River and sea travel\r\n \r\nIn the past, overcrowding and poor safety standards have led to several accidents on Red Sea ferries and Nile cruisers. There were four significant fires on Nile cruisers between September 2006 and November 2012.\r\n \r\n###Adventure travel\r\n \r\nBefore undertaking any adventure activity, make sure you are covered by your travel insurance.\r\n \r\nNineteen people, including two British nationals, died in a hot air balloon accident in Luxor in February 2013. Some UK tour operators have not been able to verify independently safety procedures for balloon flights and are not selling balloon flights to their customers. Speak to your tour company before booking a balloon flight.\r\n \r\nIf you are considering diving or snorkelling in any of the Red Sea resorts be aware that safety standards of diving operators can vary considerably. Never dive or snorkel unaccompanied. Where possible make bookings through your tour representative. Very cheap operators may not provide adequate safety and insurance standards. Diving beyond the depth limit of your insurance policy will invalidate your cover.\r\n \r\nShark attacks of any kind are very unusual in the Red Sea. There were a series of attacks in Sharm el Sheikh in late 2010 and in March 2015, a German tourist was killed by a shark attack in al-Qusair. You should monitor updates issued by the local authorities and your tour operator.\r\n \r\nMake sure your travel insurance, or that of your tour or dive company, provides adequate cover for the costs involved in any air/sea rescue. The current fee can exceed US$4,000 per hour. The Egyptian authorities will only undertake air/sea rescue operations on receipt of a guarantee of payment.\r\n \r\nThere have been several serious quad bike accidents involving British nationals in resort areas. Take the same precautions as you would in the UK and note that safety standards can vary considerably. Always wear a crash helmet.\r\n \r\n###Landmines \r\n\r\nThere remains a small risk from unexploded landmines in certain desert areas in the north west of Egypt near to Alamein, and on some limited stretches of the Mediterranean coast near Marsa Matrouh and on the Red Sea coast south of Suez. Danger areas are usually well marked with signs and barbed wire fencing. Take care and follow local advice, especially if planning trips off marked roads."},{"content_type":"text/html","content":"<h3 id=\"political-and-security-situation\">Political and security situation</h3>\n\n<p>Since January 2011 Egypt has experienced significant political turmoil, sometimes involving violent protests and disturbances, which have resulted in a number of deaths. </p>\n\n<p>Follow the news on television and radio closely, and take advice from the authorities, hotels and tour operators.
