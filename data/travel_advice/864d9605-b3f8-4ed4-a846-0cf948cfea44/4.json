Street crime is common in Managua but also occurs in other large towns. Pickpockets and thieves operate on public transport and around bus terminals.

Take note of the colour and number of the vehicle before you get in. \r\n\r\nIt’s a common local practice to share taxis with strangers.  If you prefer to avoid this, agree a fare with the driver for a solo journey. Always agree the fare before you set off. Many assaults and robberies have occurred when using unlicensed taxis and when a stranger offers to call a taxi for you. Don’t take a taxi if it’s been called for you by someone you do not know well.\r\n    \r\nThere have been reports of cars being stopped and passengers assaulted at traffic lights in Managua. Keep the windows of your car closed and the doors locked.  \r\n    \r\nDon’t travel on buses after dark.  \r\n    \r\nTake care when walking around, particularly in markets, bus stations, the area around the old cathedral in Managua and poorer areas of towns. Don’t walk alone after dark.  \r\n    \r\nThere have been violent attacks against foreigners in hotels and houses. Use hotels that are staffed at the front desk 24 hours a day and have adequate security measures.  \r\n    \r\nAvoid wearing jewellery. Don’t carry large amounts of cash, credit cards or other valuables.  \r\n\r\n###Local travel  \r\nThe North Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAN) is very remote. You should plan any travel to this area carefully.  \r\n    \r\nDon’t hike on volcanoes or in other remote areas without an experienced guide.  \r\n    \r\nAlthough extensive de-mining operations have been carried out in rural areas of northern Nicaragua, some landmines may remain. Take care if you venture off the main roads.  \r\n    \r\nThere have been occasional incidents of violent crime in Bonanza, La Rosita, Siuna and Little Corn Island.  \r\n    \r\nAvoid road travel after dark due to the presence of armed bandits.  \r\n  \r\n###Road travel  \r\nRoad conditions are generally poor and large potholes can appear overnight. There's no street lighting on the main highways between major cities and only minimal street lighting in towns. Driving standards are low and the condition of vehicles, particularly taxis and buses is poor. Ignoring traffic lights is common practice.

Strong currents off sections of Nicaragua's Pacific coast have resulted in drownings. Warning signs are not posted and lifeguards and rescue equipment are not readily available.    \r\n    \r\n###Political situation  \r\nPolitical demonstrations can happen at any time and at short notice.
