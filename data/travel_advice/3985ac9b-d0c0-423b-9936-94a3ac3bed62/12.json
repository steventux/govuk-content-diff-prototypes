However, the British Embassy has received increased reports of theft especially in larger cities, at Geneva airport and on trains to/from Geneva.\r\n\r\nWatch out for pickpockets, confidence tricksters and thieves in city centres, airports, railway stations, on trains and in other public places. Don’t leave your luggage unattended at any time. Don´t keep your passport, credit cards and other valuables in the same place. Use the inside compartments in bags where possible. Carry your bag across your body rather than on your shoulder. \r\n\r\nIf you’re travelling by train, take precautions against being burgled, especially at night. Pickpockets can work in gangs: one to distract you while the other one goes into your bag. Keep your belongings close to you in restaurants and bars. \r\nAlcohol and drugs can lead to you being less alert, less in control, and less aware of your environment. If you’re going to drink, know your limit and take sensible precautions. Don’t become separated from friends.\r\n\r\n[This leaflet produced by the British Embassy and the Swiss transport police](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/travel-safely-travel-aware) gives more advice on what to do if you're pickpocketed, including useful contacts.\r\n\r\n###Scams\r\nForeign visitors and residents can be targeted by scam artists. Scams can cause great financial loss. If you receive an e-mail claiming to be from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs [HMRC](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/security/examples.htm) offering a tax refund on provision of your bank details you should make absolutely sure that it is not part of a scam.\r\n\r\n###Road Travel\r\n    \r\nRoad users have to comply with [Switzerland’s road regulations](https://www.ch.ch/en/how-behave-road-traffic/), such as speed limits, rules on alcohol intake and child security, or risk fines or other punishments. \r\n\r\nFollow instructions given by local police and officials on the main alpine transit routes and in areas of heavy traffic congestion.  \r\n    \r\nA reflective jacket and a warning triangle are compulsory and must be kept within easy reach (not in the boot). You must also have a first aid kit in the car. Radar detectors are prohibited in Switzerland whether in use or not. The limit for alcohol in the bloodstream is 0.5% and police may request any driver to undergo a breath test or drugs test. Swiss traffic regulations are strictly enforced. Any serious breach of the regulations can result in heavy fines and/or imprisonment.   \r\n    \r\nThe speed limit on Swiss motorways is 120km/h unless otherwise indicated. To travel on Swiss motorways, road users must purchase and display a vignette (sticker) or face large on the spot fines. You can buy a vignette at most border crossings, petrol stations, post offices, by phone (+800 1002 0030) and [online](http://swisstravelsystem.com). The price of a vignette is currently CHF 40.  \r\n    \r\nMany roads are narrow and winding and road conditions can deteriorate fast even in summer, especially during heavy rainfall and subsequent snowfall at higher altitudes. You should reduce your speed significantly to suit the conditions.  \r\n    \r\nAlpine winters often make driving more difficult. You should equip your car with winter tyres and snow-chains, and check road conditions prior to departure. The Swiss motoring organisation, TCS, has up-to-date information on its [website](http://www.tcs.ch).  \r\n    \r\nDrivers must be 18 years of age and hold a full valid UK, or other EU/EEA, driving licence, insurance and vehicle documents. There is no need for an International Driving Permit.  \r\n    \r\nIn 2016 there were 216 road deaths in Switzerland. See the [European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/going_abroad/index_en.htm), [AA](http://www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/overseas/general_advice.html) and [RAC](http://www.rac.co.uk/travel/driving-abroad/countries/switzerland/) guides on driving in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nMotorway journeys are usually trouble-free, but if you´re involved in a car accident, use the orange emergency phones to ask for help.\r\n\r\n###Rail travel  \r\n  \r\nInformation about rail services is available on the [Swiss Travel System website](http://www.swisstravelsystem.com/en/home.html).\r\n\r\n###Outdoor sports activities\r\n    \r\nMake sure your insurance covers you for sports activities such as skiing, potholing, mountain biking and mountaineering. Travel insurance should also include mountain rescue services and helicopter costs.  \r\n\r\nMany accidents happen due to insufficient information, inappropriate equipment or overestimation of your own capabilities. Don´t undertake any activity alone, and consider hiring a guide for expert advice. Always leave copies of your itinerary with someone. Follow the advice given by local authorities and guides. To ignore such advice could put yourself and other mountain users in danger. \r\n    \r\nThe following alpine hazards exist throughout the year:\r\n\r\n- avalanches and snow drifts\r\n- landslides and flooding\r\n- glacial crevasses and hollows\r\n- rockfall\r\n- thunder storms and lightning\r\n- altitude sickness\r\n- sun exposure\r\n- sudden weather changes\r\n\r\nYou should:\r\n\r\n- take note of weather forecasts and conditions\r\n- make sure you are physically fit and have the necessary experience\r\n- be in a team of at least two\r\n- inform someone of your plans.\r\n- take warm clothes and wet weather gear.\r\n- use sun block (SPF20 or higher) and sun glasses.\r\n\r\nTo check the latest avalanche risk, visit the website of the [Swiss Federal Commission for Snow and Avalanche Research](http://www.slf.ch/lawinenbulletin/index_EN). Observe all warnings about avalanches and where appropriate consider carrying search equipment. Conditions on roads in mountainous areas can quickly become difficult in winter. You should carry water, food and warm clothing and medicines in your vehicle. \r\n\r\nOff-piste skiing is highly dangerous. You should follow all safety instructions carefully given the danger of avalanches in some areas and particularly during times of heavy snow. Avalanche beepers (receivers) are the most common rescue devices and when properly used provide the fastest way of locating an avalanche victim. \r\n\r\nRead more about how to [stay safe on the slopes](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/winter-sports-stay-safe-on-the-slopes).\r\n\r\nFor more information and advice on enjoying outdoor activities safely and responsibly, visit the [Official website of Swiss Tourism.](http://kanuland.myswitzerland.com/en/behaviour-en-route.html)"},{"content_type":"text/html","content":"<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>There is a low rate of serious crime in Switzerland.

The question of refunds and cancellations is a matter for you and your travel company. Travel companies make their own decisions about whether or not to offer customers a refund. Many of them use our travel advice to help them reach these decisions, but we do not instruct travel companies on when they can or can’t offer a refund to their customers.\r\n\r\nFor more information about your rights if you wish to cancel a holiday, visit [the Citizen’s Advice Bureau website](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/cancelling-a-holiday/). For help resolving problems with a flight booking, visit the [website of the Civil Aviation Authority](https://www.caa.co.uk/Passengers/Resolving-travel-problems/). For questions about travel insurance, contact your insurance provider and if you’re not happy with their response, you can complain to the [Financial Ombudsman Service](http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumer/complaints.htm). \r\n\r\n###Registering your travel details with us\r\n\r\nWe’re no longer asking people to register with us before travel. Our [foreign travel checklist](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-checklist) and [crisis overseas page](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas) suggest things you can do before and during foreign travel to plan your trip and stay safe.\r\n\r\n###Previous versions of FCO travel advice\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking for a previous version of the FCO travel advice, visit the [National Archives website](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/*/http:/www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice). If you can’t find the page you’re looking for there, [send us a request](mailto:traveladvicepublicenquiries@fco.gov.uk). \r\n\r\n###Further help\r\n\r\nIf you’re a British national and you have a question about travelling abroad that isn’t covered in our foreign travel advice or elsewhere on GOV.UK, you can [submit an enquiry](mailto:traveladvicepublicenquiries@fco.gov.uk).  We’re not able to provide tailored advice for specific trips.\r\n"},{"content_type":"text/html","content":"\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Help\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>If you’re abroad and you need emergency help from the UK government, contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies\">nearest British embassy, consulate or high commission</a>.
