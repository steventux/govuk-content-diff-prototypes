Petty theft of personal items including passports is the main problem, but gang muggings and armed robberies can occur even in daylight on busy streets. Eight foreign nationals (including one British national) have gone missing in the last few years, with some related to criminal activity.\r\n\r\nDon’t wear jewellery or carry large amounts of cash. Take particular care of your belongings in hostels and hotels. Lock valuables in a hotel room safe. Don’t use street money-changers.\r\n\r\nBe vigilant when using buses, as thefts are increasingly common. Bags in overhead compartments are particularly vulnerable. Thieves have simple but effective ways of distracting you. Be particularly watchful of your valuables at the beach. Avoid poorly lit or remote areas.\r\n\r\nAvoid using unofficial taxis - ‘taxi piratas’. Violent incidents involving tourists have been reported. Official taxis are red with a triangular sticker and plastic box on the roof with the name and number of the taxi company. Ideally, use radio-dispatched taxis. Make sure the driver's ID is clearly visible on the dashboard and that the driver uses the meter.\r\n\r\nViolent attacks including rape and other sexual offences are rare but there have been some in recent years. You should maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as in the UK, including when using ATMs. Don’t accept lifts from strangers. Avoid leaving drinks unattended in bars as there have been reports of ‘spiked’ drinks resulting in assault and theft.\r\n\r\nCar theft and theft from cars is common, even during relatively short stops at restaurant and other car parks. Don’t leave valuables in hire cars, even in the boot, and avoid leaving belongings where they can be seen from outside the car. Park in secure car parks with visible security staff, or in well-lit busy areas. There have been incidents where slashed tyres have given thieves the opportunity to help change your vehicle's tyres while an accomplice steals from the car.\r\n\r\n###Local travel\r\n\r\nIf you’re visiting jungle areas you should go with an experienced local guide. If you visit a volcano pay strict attention to restrictions on entry to dangerous areas. When there is the risk of an eruption the national park is closed to visitors until the danger has passed.\r\n\r\nEmergency contact numbers are:  Police Emergency - 911; Ambulance - 911 or 128; Fire Service - 911 or 118; Police Investigative Service - 911 or 2221-5337.\r\n    \r\n###Road travel\r\n\r\nYou can drive in Costa Rica on a UK Driving Licence or an [International Driving Permit](http://www.theaa.com/getaway/idp/index.html).\r\n\r\nIf you enter the country in a right hand drive vehicle you should be aware there have been instances where such vehicles have been refused entry as they contravene local law and are ineligible for local insurance.\r\n\r\nRoad conditions are generally good on main routes, although there can be potholes due to heavy rains in the rainy season. Landslides in the rainy season sometimes block the road between San José and Guapiles on the way to Limón and the new San Jose/Caldera Highway. Take care when approaching bridges as these are often only one-way, even if the road is two-way.\r\n\r\nThe standard of driving is lower than in the UK. Accidents are often caused by speeding or overtaking irresponsibly. Traffic lights are often ignored. Traffic police strictly enforce speed limits. If you have an accident where somebody has been injured or where blame has not been accepted by the other driver, you must not move the vehicle until the traffic police have arrived. The Traffic Police (Transito - telephone 2222-9330 or 2222-9245) and the Insurance Investigator (INS - telephone 800-800-8000) must come to the scene of the accident to complete accident reports.\r\n\r\nCriminals sometimes cause deliberate collisions as a means of stopping vehicles in order to commit robberies or other crimes. If you think a collision was a deliberate act by another driver to make you stop, consider driving on until you reach a safe place like a police station or garage. In these circumstances you will need to be able to explain your actions to the traffic police. \r\n    \r\n###Swimming and water sports\r\n\r\nTake extra care when taking part in water sports and swimming from all beaches in Costa Rica. Rip tides are very common. There are normally no lifeguards. You should seek reliable local advice. Eighty six people died by drowning on Costa Rican beaches in the first 8 months of 2015.\r\n\r\nThere are regular sightings of crocodiles along the Pacific Coast near beaches popular with surfers (from Playa Azul down to Playa Esterillos) and there have been attacks in recent years.\r\n    \r\n###Adventure activities, sea and river travel\r\n\r\nSafety standards for adventure activities and on small boats are not always of a high standard. If you plan to undertake any of these, you should arrange this with an established company with experienced instructors. \r\n"},{"content_type":"text/html","content":"<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>There has been a steady increase in crime.
