We treat our staff with respect and offer equal opportunities to everyone we work with. We insist on respectful and polite behaviour from staff, those in our care and others who we work with. We recognise that discrimination, harassment and bullying can still happen and we take quick and appropriate action whenever we find them.</p>\n\n<p>More information on our equality objectives is available at the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/corporate-reports/noms/equality\">Ministry for Justice</a> and in our <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/corporate-reports/noms/2013/noms-business-plan-2013-2014.pdf\">current business plan</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"equality-annual-reports-and-reviews\">Equality annual reports and reviews</h2>\n\n<p>We publish two equality reports each year, one on staff and one on those in our care, describing the work we have done to meet our equalities objectives.
