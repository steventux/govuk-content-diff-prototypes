GDS were satisfied that the Prison Visit Booking service have given due thought to the safety of the service and involved technical and security experts accordingly, and that they are working in an agile method and are proactively improving the service on an ongoing basis in response to user needs.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nFor the service to succeed at Live assessment, during the Beta it will be vital that Prison Visit Booking:\n\n- publish the remainder of the service’s code openly, and ensure that you are using an appropriate licence both for the newly published code and the component of the service you have already open sourced\n- put in place plans to ensure that there will be a permanent team available to iterate and improve the service post go-live, and that this team includes time from a dedicated person with the expertise to gather and gain insight from analytics data\n- evaluate the assisted digital support pilot during beta and ensure that the appropriate levels of support are in place for the live service. This should include:\n  - ensuring assisted digital support is made available to all users who need it\n  - measuring volumes and cost per minute of assisted digital per channel, and showing they are in line with estimates\n  - showing that assisted digital users are aware of support and can access it easily\n  - showing positive feedback from users and experts\n  - verifying that there is sufficient capacity to deliver phone and face-by-face support, including that external organisations are sufficiently funded to meet demand\n  - including messages within the service itself to signpost the available support\n- publish information about the cookies used by the service including their purpose and how long they are stored for (see&nbsp;[https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/cookies](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/cookies)&nbsp;for more)\n\n**Next steps**\n\nThis service has been given approval to launch as a beta with a start page on&nbsp;[GOV.UK](http://gov.uk/).
