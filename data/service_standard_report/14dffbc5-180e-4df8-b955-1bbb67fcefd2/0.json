Only during later sprints were a wider external group engaged to test prototypes remotely, although the team have made very good progress with these users.\n\nA number of bugs and usability issues were noted when the Alpha service was demonstrated during the assessment. The RCR team have since responded quickly to deal with priority actions. The updated service will be demonstrated to the assessment team again on 25/03/14. The other issues identified should not be considered show stoppers and therefore wouldn’t prevent the service going live, as long as the RCR team remain committed to addressing them.\n\nThere are minor concerns over the clarity of a plan for continuous improvement, especially as there are now a number of items in the project backlog. Although the assessment team have passed the criteria for CI and there is a budget allocated, the RCR Service Manager will need to demonstrate clearly how CI is working in practice when the service applies to move into Live. They have also agreed to provide a statement to the assessment team on their CI plan.\n\nThe assessment team recommend to the Digital Leader that the RCR service moves to Live Beta.\n\n* * *\n\n## Digital by Default Service Standard criteria\n\n| **Criteria** | **Passed** | **Criteria** | **Passed** |\n| 1 | Yes | 2 | Yes |\n| 3 | Yes | 4 | Yes |\n| 5 | Yes | 6 | Yes |\n| 7 | Yes | 8 | Yes |\n| 9 | Yes | 10 | Yes |\n| 11 | Yes | 12 | Yes |\n| 13 | Yes | 14 | Yes |\n| 15 | No | 16 | Yes |\n| 17 | Yes | 18 | Yes |\n| 19 | Yes | 20 | Yes |\n| 21 | N/A | 22 | N/A |\n| 23 | N/A | 24 | Yes |\n| 25 | Yes | 26 | Yes |\n\n| **Details of criteria that are not applicable to this service** |\n| 15 – No. Publishing Environment Agency source code is an outstanding issue with the EA and waiting on a Corporate decision |"},{"content_type":"text/html","content":"<hr>\n\n<p>Anglers are required by law to complete salmon and sea trout catch returns by 31 December each year; if they fished, how much fishing they did and what they caught. 35,000 rod licence owners will be eligible to use the service.</p>\n\n<p>25,000 rod catch returns are currently returned annually.
