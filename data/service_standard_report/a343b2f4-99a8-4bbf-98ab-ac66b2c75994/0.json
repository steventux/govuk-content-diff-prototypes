This should go beyond rolling out existing products to many services and be based on a clear articulation of the most important user needs the team is aiming to meet.\n- The team should develop a clear, structured and transparent approach to prioritising user needs and resolving potential conflicts between the needs of the different users of the platform the team has identified.\n- The team should prioritise and develop a clear roadmap for its work to allow services to self-serve where they are using standard dashboard products. This will free up the team to work towards delivering its wider product vision.\n- The team should extend its research more fully to include the users in the ‘secondary’ list of users.\n- The team should further develop its approach to measuring the extent to which the product is demonstrably meeting real user needs. This should include more use of the available data about user engagement with the platform (eg analytics such as the percentage of users who drill down to the tabular content, or who download data, etc).\n- The assessment panel would encourage the team to share more of its thinking about priorities, user needs and design decisions as part of their new comms strategy\n\n* * *\n\n## Digital by Default Service Standard criteria\n\n| **Criteria** | **Passed** | **Criteria** | **Passed** |\n| 1 | Yes | 2 | Yes |\n| 3 | Yes | 4 | Yes |\n| 5 | Yes | 6 | Yes |\n| 7 | Yes | 8 | Yes |\n| 9 | Yes | 10 | Yes |\n| 11 | Yes | 12 | Yes |\n| 13 | Yes | 14 | Yes |\n| 15 | Yes | 16 | Yes |\n| 17 | Yes | 18 | Yes |\n| 19 | Yes | 20 | Yes |\n| 21 | Yes | 22 | Yes |\n| 23 | Yes | 24 | Yes |\n| 25 | Yes | 26 | Yes |"},{"content_type":"text/html","content":"<p>The platform provides details on the performance of a service, both digital and assisted digital.
