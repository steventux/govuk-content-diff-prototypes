The aim of this service is to provide users who currently use the paper part of the driving licence with a new digital version that can be easily accessed. The service will display the information currently available on the paper counterpart and make it available to all those who have a right to see it.\r\n\r\n## Outcome of service assessment\r\n\r\nThe Share Driving Record Service has been reviewed against the 26 points of the Service Standard at the end of the Alpha development.\r\n\r\nAfter consideration the assessment panel has concluded that the Share Driving Record Service is on track to meet the Digital by Default Service Standard at this early stage of development.\r\n\r\n## Reasons\r\n\r\nIt was clear from the assessment that the team are using an agile approach to meeting the user needs for Share Driving Record through prototyping and regular user research. Since this service is being built on the IEP platform, on which the View Driving Record Service is soon to be live, the panel was satisfied that appropriate technology and security choices were being made, and the team have the ability to rapidly iterate the service. The team already have a lot of benchmarking data for a service at alpha stage and are talking to the performance platform about measuring this new service.\r\n\r\n## Recommendations\r\n\r\nFor the service to succeed at Beta assessment, during the Alpha it will be vital that the team:\r\n\r\n* work to publish the service’s code openly as soon as possible\r\n\r\n* take action on GDS’s design recommendations made for both ‘View Driving Record’ and ‘Share Driving Record’ (to be provided as a separate document)\r\n\r\n* develop and test the feature which informs users that someone has looked at their driving record\r\n\r\n* ensure that appropriate levels of assisted digital support are in place for the beta, including:\r\n  \r\n   * demonstrating if there is no assisted digital requirement with sound user research\r\n   \r\n   * researching the needs of users (including businesses of all sizes and citizens) who cannot use the service independently, to give a full picture of who needs what kind of support\r\n  \r\n   * explicit and adequate assisted digital expertise must be either embedded within or available to the team.\r\n\r\ndo further work to discover whether offering an API would be valuable. It was suggested that an API was desired by customers, but there did not appear to have been much exploration of this. One of the [objectives of an alpha](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/phases/alpha#the-objective-of-an-alpha) should be to validate user needs. An API feels like a new area ripe for discovering whether it is a viable solution for meeting those user needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Digital by Default Service Standard criteria\r\n\r\n| Criteria | Passed | Criteria | Passed |\r\n-|-\r\n| 1 | Yes | 2 | Yes |\r\n| 3 | Yes | 4 | Yes |\r\n| 5 | Yes | 6 | Yes |\r\n| 7 | Yes | 8 | Yes |\r\n| 9 | Yes | 10 | Yes |\r\n| 11 | Yes | 12 | Yes |\r\n| 13 | Yes | 14 | Yes |\r\n| 15 | Yes | 16 | Yes |\r\n| 17 | Yes | 18 | Yes |\r\n| 19 | Yes | 20 | Yes |\r\n| 21 | Yes | 22 | Yes |\r\n| 23 | Yes | 24 | Yes |\r\n| 25 | Yes | 26 | Yes |\r\n\r\n*[KPIs]: Key Performance Indicators\r\n*[APIs]: Application Programming Interface\r\n*[DfT]: Department for Transport\r\n*[DVLA]: Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency"},{"content_type":"text/html","content":"<p><strong>Department / Agency:</strong><br>\n<abbr title=\"Department for Transport\">DfT</abbr>/<abbr title=\"Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\">DVLA</abbr></p>\n\n<p><strong>Date of Assessment:</strong><br>\n7 July 2014</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assessment Stage:</strong><br>\nAlpha Review</p>\n\n<p><strong>Result of Assessment:</strong><br>\nPass</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lead Assessor:</strong><br>\nA.
