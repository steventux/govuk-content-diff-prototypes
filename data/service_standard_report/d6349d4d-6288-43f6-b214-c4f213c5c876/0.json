If the scope of the service changes the user base, the team may need to undertake research with assisted digital users and design, test and provide appropriate assisted digital support which meets user needs.\n\n* * *\n\n## Digital by Default Service Standard criteria\n\n| Criteria | Passed | Criteria | Passed |\n| 1 | Yes | 2 | Yes |\n| 3 | Yes | 4 | Yes |\n| 5 | Yes | 6 | Yes |\n| 7 | Yes | 8 | Yes |\n| 9 | Yes | 10 | N/A |\n| 11 | Yes | 12 | Yes |\n| 13 | Yes | 14 | Yes |\n| 15 | Yes | 16 | Yes |\n| 17 | Yes | 18 | Yes |\n| 19 | Yes | 20 | Yes |\n| 21 | Yes | 22 | Yes |\n| 23 | Yes | 24 | Yes |\n| 25 | Yes | 26 | Yes |"},{"content_type":"text/html","content":"<p>Users are business travellers or frequent flyers to the UK that meet the current eligibility criteria and have passed the detailed background checks conducted during the application process.  Once approved, members are able to use the ePassport gates (if they have a biometric passport) at Gatwick or Heathrow airports.</p>\n\n<p>https://www.gov.uk/transformation/apply-registered-traveller.html</p>\n\n<p><strong>Department / Agency:</strong><br>\nHO / BF</p>\n\n<p><strong>Date of Assessment:</strong><br>\n22/9/2014</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assessment stage:</strong><br>\nBeta</p>\n\n<p><strong>Result of Assessment:</strong><br>\nPass</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lead Assessor:</strong><br>\nJ.
