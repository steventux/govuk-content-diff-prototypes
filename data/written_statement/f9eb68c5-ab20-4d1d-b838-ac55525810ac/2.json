This provides Departmental Pool Cars which are a shared resource for a department to use as efficiently as possible. In addition, the Car Service offers a small pre-bookable service utilising any spare capacity.</p>\n\n<p>These charges do not necessarily reflect the total spend on car services as some departments have arrangements with other providers. The Treasury has 2 Cabinet Ministers. The former Chancellor used the Government Car Service to supply a driver and vehicle for his protection package whereas the PM, Home, Foreign, Defence and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State used the Metropolitan Police. Such charges are not included in the table.</p>\n</div>","political":true,"delivered_on":"2017-02-09T15:30:00+00:00","change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2017-02-09T16:00:41.000+00:00","note":"First published."}],"image":{"alt_text":"Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon","url":"/government/uploads/system/uploads/person/image/408/LordAhmad-10Jul2013_0686.jpg"},"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","current":true},"first_public_at":"2017-02-09T16:00:41.000+00:00"},"routes":[{"path":"/government/speeches/ministerial-cars-financial-year-2015-to-2016","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"whitehall-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"written_statement","schema_name":"speech","first_published_at":"2017-02-09T16:00:41Z","base_path":"/government/speeches/ministerial-cars-financial-year-2015-to-2016","description":"Outlines charges incurred by departments for the use of official government cars.","content_id":"f9eb68c5-ab20-4d1d-b838-ac55525810ac","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"D9","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/department-for-transport","base_path":"/government/organisations/department-for-transport","content_id":"4c717efc-f47b-478e-a76d-ce1ae0af1946","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-12-20T14:44:50Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Department for Transport","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"department-for-transport","logo":{"formatted_title":"Department<br/>for Transport","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}}],"policies":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/government/policies/government-transparency-and-accountability","base_path":"/government/policies/government-transparency-and-accountability","content_id":"5d278051-7631-11e4-a3cb-005056011aef","description":"","document_type":"policy","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-05-26T15:15:26Z","schema_name":"policy","title":"Government transparency and accountability","withdrawn":false,"links":{"working_groups":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/government/speeches/ministerial-cars-financial-year-2015-to-2016","base_path":"/government/speeches/ministerial-cars-financial-year-2015-to-2016","content_id":"f9eb68c5-ab20-4d1d-b838-ac55525810ac","description":"Outlines charges incurred by departments for the use of official government cars.","document_type":"written_statement","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-02-09T16:00:41Z","schema_name":"speech","title":"Ministerial cars, financial year 2015 to 2016","withdrawn":false,"links":{}}]}}],"policy_areas":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/government/topics/government-efficiency-transparency-and-accountability","base_path":"/government/topics/government-efficiency-transparency-and-accountability","content_id":"0a12a282-10eb-4c83-9db4-16540ae5ab01","description":null,"document_type":"placeholder_policy_area","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-02-04T11:25:06Z","schema_name":"placeholder_policy_area","title":"Government efficiency, transparency and accountability","withdrawn":false,"links":{}}],"related_policies":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/government/policies/government-transparency-and-accountability","base_path":"/government/policies/government-transparency-and-accountability","content_id":"5d278051-7631-11e4-a3cb-005056011aef","description":"","document_type":"policy","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-05-26T15:15:26Z","schema_name":"policy","title":"Government transparency and accountability","withdrawn":false,"links":{}}],"speaker":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/government/people/lord-ahmad-of-wimbledon","base_path":"/government/people/lord-ahmad-of-wimbledon","content_id":"852e8a1e-c0f1-11e4-8223-005056011aef","description":null,"document_type":"person","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-07-25T14:16:14Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon","withdrawn":false,"links":{}}],"available_translations":[{"title":"Ministerial cars, financial year 2015 to 2016","public_updated_at":"2017-02-09T16:00:41Z","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"written_statement","schema_name":"speech","base_path":"/government/speeches/ministerial-cars-financial-year-2015-to-2016","description":"Outlines charges incurred by departments for the use of official government cars.","api_path":"/api/content/government/speeches/ministerial-cars-financial-year-2015-to-2016","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"f9eb68c5-ab20-4d1d-b838-ac55525810ac","locale":"en"}]},"format":"speech","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"announcements","government_document_supertype":"statements","payload_version":0}
