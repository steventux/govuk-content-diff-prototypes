To support the process, the government has agreed that it will provide information to assist the Speaker in considering whether to certify that Bill or any of its provisions for the purposes of English votes for English laws. Bill provisions that relate exclusively to England or to England and Wales, and which have a subject matter within the legislative competence of one or more of the devolved legislatures, can be certified.</p>\n\n<p>This analysis reflects the position should all the government amendments be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>The memorandum can be found on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/busservices/documents.html\">Bill documents page of the Parliament website</a> and I have deposited a copy in the Libraries of the
