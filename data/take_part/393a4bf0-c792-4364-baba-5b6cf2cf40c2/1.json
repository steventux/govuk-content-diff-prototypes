Many have been set up by local parents, community groups or teachers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-get-involved\">How can I get involved?</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re interested in setting up a new school, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.newschoolsnetwork.org/set-up-a-free-school\">New Schools Network website</a> for more information and advice. You can call them on 020 7537 9208  or email <a href=\"mailto:info@newschoolsnetwork.org\">info@newschoolsnetwork.org</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/leadership/typesofschools/freeschools/a00222175/open\">Department for Education (<abbr title=\"Department for Education\">DfE</abbr>)</a> also has details of the process and the criteria applications will be assessed against.</p>\n\n<p>Applications to set up a new school need to be submitted to the <abbr title=\"Department for Education\">DfE</abbr>, which runs 3 application rounds each year.</p>\n\n<p>The process for setting up a new school has been streamlined. It usually takes little more than a year from the <abbr title=\"Department for Education\">DfE</abbr> granting initial approval for a school to the school opening its doors to pupils.</p>\n\n<p>So, although the process for setting up a new school is rigorous it’s now much faster and simpler. </p>\n\n</div>","image":{"url":"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/take_part_page/image/5/s300_DONE_Set-up-a-new-school-960.jpg","alt_text":"Teacher writing on a white board"}},"routes":[{"path":"/government/get-involved/take-part/set-up-a-new-school","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"take_part","schema_name":"take_part","first_published_at":"2016-02-29T09:24:10Z","base_path":"/government/get-involved/take-part/set-up-a-new-school","description":"Free schools are independent, state-funded schools.","content_id":"393a4bf0-c792-4364-baba-5b6cf2cf40c2","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"available_translations":[{"title":"Set up a new school ","public_updated_at":"2015-02-18T10:42:55Z","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"take_part","schema_name":"take_part","base_path":"/government/get-involved/take-part/set-up-a-new-school","description":"Free schools are independent, state-funded schools.","api_path":"/api/content/government/get-involved/take-part/set-up-a-new-school","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"393a4bf0-c792-4364-baba-5b6cf2cf40c2","locale":"en"}]},"format":"take_part","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"other","government_document_supertype":"other","payload_version":0}
