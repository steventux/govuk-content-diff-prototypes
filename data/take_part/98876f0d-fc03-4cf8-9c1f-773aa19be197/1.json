Councils are looking to local groups for innovative ideas on how to shape services.</p>\n\n<p>So, whether you’re a local community group, a social enterprise, a parish council or a group of council employees, you can develop your ability to run local government services.</p>\n\n<p>If you’d like to take over the service entirely, the Right to Challenge lets you set out your proposals to your local council, which must consider them.</p>\n\n<p>If the council accepts your proposal, you can compete to run the service in an open competition.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-get-involved\">How can I get involved?</h2>\n<p>Speak to your local authority about your initial idea and get more information about the service, its costs, the number of staff involved and any other relevant details.</p>\n\n<p>Councils can set time limits on when they will accept a challenge, so you will need to find out from them if this applies in your area.</p>\n\n<p>Think about your own group or organisation’s capability and whether you need to develop any particular aspects of it to be able to compete to run a service.</p>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://mycommunity.org.uk/local-services/\">My Community Rights website</a> has more details about the process and the support available.</p>\n\n<p>Once you’re ready, you can send a written expression of interest to your local authority.</p>\n</div>","image":{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/take_part_page/image/10/s300_Challenge_to_run_960.jpg","alt_text":"Girl reading in a library"}},"routes":[{"path":"/government/get-involved/take-part/challenge-to-run-a-local-service","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"take_part","schema_name":"take_part","first_published_at":"2016-02-29T09:24:10Z","base_path":"/government/get-involved/take-part/challenge-to-run-a-local-service","description":"Your group could take over the running of a local service, if you could make improvements.","content_id":"98876f0d-fc03-4cf8-9c1f-773aa19be197","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"available_translations":[{"title":"Challenge to run a local service","public_updated_at":"2016-08-25T14:23:58Z","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"take_part","schema_name":"take_part","base_path":"/government/get-involved/take-part/challenge-to-run-a-local-service","description":"Your group could take over the running of a local service, if you could make improvements.","api_path":"/api/content/government/get-involved/take-part/challenge-to-run-a-local-service","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"98876f0d-fc03-4cf8-9c1f-773aa19be197","locale":"en"}]},"format":"take_part","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"other","government_document_supertype":"other","payload_version":0}
