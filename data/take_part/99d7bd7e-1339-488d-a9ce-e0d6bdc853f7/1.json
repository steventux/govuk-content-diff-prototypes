{"title":"Volunteer as a school governor","public_updated_at":"2014-06-18T11:56:01Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><h2 id=\"what-is-it\">What is it?</h2>\n<p>The governing body is the strategic decision-making body in each school and academy. It has a crucial role in making sure every child gets the best possible education. </p>\n\n<p>Governing bodies: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>set the school’s strategic direction</li>\n  <li>hold the head teacher to account for a school’s performance</li>\n  <li>ensure that the school’s budget is properly managed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Governing bodies meet at least once a term. Many use sub-committees to look at more detailed aspects of their work and advise them on decisions. Committees often look at issues like pupil performance, the curriculum, staffing, finance and premises. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-get-involved\">How can I get involved?</h2>\n<p>Governing bodies need committed and enthusiastic people with relevant skills. Training can be provided and there are many sources of advice and support available. </p>\n\n<p>Governors are volunteers, but can receive ‘out of pocket’ expenses. </p>\n\n<p>The Inspiring Governors Alliance was launched in May 2014 to encourage more people to get involved. You can find out more about becoming a governor from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.inspiringgovernors.org/\">Inspiring Governors website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can also contact a school local to you, or your <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-council\">local council</a>, to find out how to become a school governor. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.becomeagovernor.org.uk/\">SGOSS</a>, the governor recruitment charity, helps to recruit governors with useful business skills and matches them with local schools. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.inspiringthefuture.org/\">Inspiring the future</a> helps people from the world of work volunteer in schools in a range of ways, including as governor.</p>\n\n<p>Information and resources for governors are available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nga.org.uk/\">National Governors’ Association</a>. The Department for Education also offers information and guidance including the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governors-handbook\">Governors’ Handbook</a> which explains the role of governors.</p>\n\n</div>","image":{"url":"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/take_part_page/image/14/s300_School_governor_960.jpg","alt_text":"Teacher in a classroom"}},"routes":[{"path":"/government/get-involved/take-part/volunteer-as-a-school-governor","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"take_part","schema_name":"take_part","first_published_at":"2016-02-29T09:24:10Z","base_path":"/government/get-involved/take-part/volunteer-as-a-school-governor","description":"Could you help set a school's direction and ensure that its budget is properly managed?
