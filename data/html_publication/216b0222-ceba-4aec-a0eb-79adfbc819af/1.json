But if you’ve had foreign tax taken off income that’s also taxable in the United Kingdom (<abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr>), you may be able to claim Foreign Tax Credit Relief (<abbr title=\"Foreign Tax Credit Relief\">FTCR</abbr>).</p>\n\n<p>You can claim <abbr title=\"Foreign Tax Credit Relief\">FTCR</abbr> for all or part of the foreign tax you paid. This lowers the amount of <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr> tax you need to pay.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"who-can-claim\">Who can claim</h2>\n<p>You must be living (resident) in the <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr>, Isle of Man or Channel Islands if you want to claim <abbr title=\"Foreign Tax Credit Relief\">FTCR</abbr>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"when-can-you-claim\">When can you claim</h2>\n<p>You can only claim <abbr title=\"Foreign Tax Credit Relief\">FTCR</abbr> if a double taxation agreement allows both countries to tax the same item of income. If there’s no double taxation agreement in place between the <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr> and that country, <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr> has unilateral relief for when double taxation agreements don’t exist or don’t apply, this means that the foreign tax is normally available as a credit but only up to the extent of the <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr> tax charged on that foreign income or gain.</p>\n\n<p>Some double taxation agreements may limit the amount of foreign tax you can claim. Limits vary from country to country and depend on your type of income.</p>\n\n<p>Find more information in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/double-taxation-treaties\">Double Taxation Treaties</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"when-you-cant-claim\">When you can’t claim</h2>\n<p>You can’t claim <abbr title=\"Foreign Tax Credit Relief\">FTCR</abbr> if a double taxation agreement exempts you from paying:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>tax on that income in the <abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr>, for example on a foreign government pension</li>\n  <li>foreign tax, for example on a foreign pension</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-much-you-can-claim\">How much you can claim</h2>\n<p>You can claim the smaller of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>foreign tax paid (or allowed by treaty)</li>\n  <li>\n<abbr title=\"United Kingdom\">UK</abbr> tax due</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<h3 id=\"example-1\">Example 1</h3>\n<p>Elinor had £15 foreign tax taken off £100 foreign interest.

From that date, you won’t pay tax on the first £5,000 of dividend income you receive (the dividend allowance). You’ll pay tax on dividends above the dividend allowance at the following rates:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>7.5% on dividend income within the basic rate band</li>\n  <li>32.5% on dividend income within the higher rate band</li>\n  <li>38.1% on dividend income within the additional rate band</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You should return all of your dividend income, even if it is less than £5,000 because it will still count towards your basic or higher rate bands, and may therefore affect the rate of tax that you pay on dividends you receive in excess of the £5,000 allowance.</p>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<h3 id=\"example-3\">Example 3</h3>\n<p>Charles’s total income is £59,800.
