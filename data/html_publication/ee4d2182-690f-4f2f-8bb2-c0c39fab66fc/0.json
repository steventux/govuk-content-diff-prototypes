Devices which have been involved in providing security functionality for an encrypted network are likely to retain information within them, even when powered down. The goal is to ensure that devices are unlikely to contain any recoverable user information, and will not be able to reconnect to the encrypted network.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"general-principles\">\n<span class=\"number\">1.1 </span>General principles</h3>\n<p>The following recommendations should be applied to all equipment involved in providing the encrypted network service:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>All certificates associated with a device (including operational, management and maintenance) should be revoked prior to device disposal.</li>\n  <li>Any other credentials associated with a device should be changed or revoked as appropriate</li>\n  <li>The principles in Information Security Standard 5 (IS5) should be followed where a device contains signficant amounts of user information or other OFFICIAL data. Note that this does not apply to devices which have only handled encrypted information.</li>\n  <li>Factory resets or device wiping shuld be employed as a general precaution.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"specific-circumstances\">\n<span class=\"number\">1.2 </span>Specific circumstances</h3>\n<p>Any equipment, such as a VPN gateway, for which CESG has published Security Procedures, should be decomissioned and disposed following the guidance in that document. Generally this will involve performing a low-level wipe of any configuration data stored in the device, followed by a reset to factory defaults. Any certificates or other credentials related to the device must be revoked and/or changed as appropriate.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"device-reuse\">\n<span class=\"number\">1.3 </span>Device reuse</h3>\n\n<p>It is acceptable to redploy endpoint devices and other equipment into similar environments (for example, moving from one public sector customer to another). As noted, credentials associated with the device should be revoked or changed, and the device itself wiped or reset in accordance with manufacturer’’s instructions, prior to repdeoloyment.</p>\n\n</div>","headings":"<ol><li><a href=\"#disposal-and-decomissioning\">Disposal and Decomissioning</a></li></ol>","public_timestamp":"2015-07-14T18:34:42.000+01:00","first_published_version":true},"routes":[{"path":"/government/publications/network-guidance-introduction/networking-guidance-disposal","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"html_publication","schema_name":"html_publication","first_published_at":null,"base_path":"/government/publications/network-guidance-introduction/networking-guidance-disposal","description":null,"content_id":"ee4d2182-690f-4f2f-8bb2-c0c39fab66fc","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"OT563","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/cesg","base_path":"/government/organisations/cesg","content_id":"e3a2fb8d-6b69-4bce-9c51-38e8e2d128c9","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-01-30T16:35:29Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"CESG","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"foreign-commonwealth-office","logo":{"formatted_title":"CESG","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}}],"parent":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/government/publications/network-guidance-introduction","base_path":"/government/publications/network-guidance-introduction","content_id":"cf234697-f71d-4172-ab09-f1fdf3cb90ad","description":"tbd","document_type":"guidance","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-07-14T17:34:42Z","schema_name":"publication","title":"Network Guidance - Introduction","withdrawn":false,"links":{}}],"available_translations":[{"title":"Networking guidance - disposal","public_updated_at":"2015-07-14T17:37:16Z","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"html_publication","schema_name":"html_publication","base_path":"/government/publications/network-guidance-introduction/networking-guidance-disposal","description":null,"api_path":"/api/content/government/publications/network-guidance-introduction/networking-guidance-disposal","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"ee4d2182-690f-4f2f-8bb2-c0c39fab66fc","locale":"en"}]},"format":"html_publication","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"other","government_document_supertype":"other","payload_version":0}
