We are looking for project ideas that fit under one of the following two themes:</p>\n\n<p>1.Youth employability: Projects to help tackle issues of youth unemployment and promote the development of Algerian entrepreneurs.\n2.Public voice: Projects to help improve freedom of expression.</p>\n\n<p>The project bids clearly need to demonstrate their contribution to one or other of the priorities and might be through working with public institutions or civil society organisations. They will be assessed on what results they will achieve, how realistic the plans are and whether the results constitute good value for money against the proposed budget. Prospective partners will also need to demonstrate how they will measure the impact of their project.</p>\n\n<p>Projects can be short or last up until March 2015. The approximate financial range is £50,000 to £500,000.\nPartners are requested to fill in the project concept note (Concept Note) and submit it to BritishEmbassy.Algiers@fco.gov.uk by 22 April. These will then be reviewed and those who are successful at this stage will be invited to submit a more detailed proposal.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that invitation to submit a full project proposal does not necessarily imply that project funding will be subsequently granted.</p>\n\n<p>All queries should be directed to the following email: BritishEmbassy.Algiers@fco.gov.uk</p>\n\n<p>Arab Partnership: Background\nThe Arab Partnership was established by the UK Government to support countries in the Middle East and North Africa which want to put in the place the building blocks of more open, free societies, underpinned by vibrant economies.
