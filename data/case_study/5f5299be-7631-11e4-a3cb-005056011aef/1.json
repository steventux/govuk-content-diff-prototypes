{"title":"Troubled families: Dudley","public_updated_at":"2014-04-30T23:01:51Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><h2 id=\"the-family\">The family</h2>\n\n<p>Mum and her boyfriend live in a property with 6 of mum’s 7 children. 5 children are from a previous relationship and 1 is with her new partner.  Her new partner also has 2 children with her eldest daughter – these 2 have both been placed for adoption. All of the children are known to social services.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-situation\">The situation</h2>\n\n<p>The family were living in a housing association house and were at risk of being evicted because of the condition of the property and rent arrears. There was dog excrement all over the garden. Inside the property was in need of repair with no adequate beds or bedding for the children. Both mum and her partner have been unemployed for a long time and the children were not attending school regularly. When they did attend, they were often dirty and unkempt and were frequently bullied because of their appearance. Mum was being prosecuted and facing a prison sentence for failing to get her children to school. Both the children and family dogs were neglected and not fed properly, with the children’s meals being provided by the maternal grandmother at her house.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"work-with-the-family-and-results\">Work with the family and results</h2>\n\n<p>Initially the family intervention worker helped with the practical things that needed doing around the home to build trust with the family. She hired a skip and helped mum clear out the rubbish from the home and showed her how to clean the property. She also helped provide beds and bedding for the children so they had somewhere safe to sleep. To stop the eviction order going through, the family was required to carry out repairs so she encouraged mum to do this and sorted out a payment plan for the rent arrears, which halted the eviction. The family intervention worker also helped mum with some basic parenting skills; together they set up routines for the cleaning and washing which improved the children’s school attendance as they were happier going in with clean clothes. She encouraged mum to re-home the family pets, as they were also neglected and contributing to the squalor of the property. By showing her how to parent, mum was able to get the older children to attend school and college full time. Social services placed the younger 2 children with long term foster families but the family intervention worker was able to solve a number of the problems for the rest of the family in the home. The house remains clean and tidy and the children well presented for school.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"progress-turning-troubled-families-lives-around-in-dudley\">Progress turning troubled families’ lives around in Dudley</h2>\n\n<p>The chart below shows progress made in Dudley as of March 2014.</p>\n\n<table class=\"js-barchart-table mc-auto-outdent\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Total number of families</td>\n      <td>740</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Number of families identified as at end of March 2014</td>\n      <td>740</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Number of families worked with as at end of March 2014</td>\n      <td>720</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Families turned around as at end of February 2014</td>\n      <td>313</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>","change_history":[],"emphasised_organisations":["2e7868a8-38f5-4ff6-b62f-9a15d1c22d28"],"first_public_at":"2014-04-28T15:32:31+01:00","format_display_type":"case_study","image":{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/25556/s300_1024px-Dudley_UK_locator_map_svg.jpg","alt_text":"Dudley map","caption":null},"tags":{"browse_pages":[],"policies":[],"topics":[]}},"routes":[{"path":"/government/case-studies/troubled-families-dudley","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"case_study","schema_name":"case_study","first_published_at":"2016-02-29T09:24:10Z","base_path":"/government/case-studies/troubled-families-dudley","description":"Progress in Dudley helping troubled families turn their lives around.","content_id":"5f5299be-7631-11e4-a3cb-005056011aef","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"document_collections":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/government/collections/troubled-families-case-studies","base_path":"/government/collections/troubled-families-case-studies","content_id":"5f5335f5-7631-11e4-a3cb-005056011aef","description":"Descriptions of how the Troubled Families programme has helped individual families across the country.","document_type":"document_collection","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2014-04-30T23:02:00Z","schema_name":"document_collection","title":"Troubled families case studies","withdrawn":false,"links":{"documents":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/government/case-studies/troubled-families-dudley","base_path":"/government/case-studies/troubled-families-dudley","content_id":"5f5299be-7631-11e4-a3cb-005056011aef","description":"Progress in Dudley helping troubled families turn their lives around.","document_type":"case_study","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2014-04-30T23:01:51Z","schema_name":"case_study","title":"Troubled families: Dudley","withdrawn":false,"links":{}}]}}],"available_translations":[{"title":"Troubled families: Dudley","public_updated_at":"2014-04-30T23:01:51Z","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"case_study","schema_name":"case_study","base_path":"/government/case-studies/troubled-families-dudley","description":"Progress in Dudley helping troubled families turn their lives around.","api_path":"/api/content/government/case-studies/troubled-families-dudley","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"5f5299be-7631-11e4-a3cb-005056011aef","locale":"en"}]},"format":"case_study","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"other","government_document_supertype":"other","payload_version":0}
