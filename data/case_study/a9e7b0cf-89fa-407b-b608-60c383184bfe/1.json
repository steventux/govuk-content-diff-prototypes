approach to demolishing one of the site’s highly contaminated facilities, the Post Irradiation Examination (PIE) Cave.</p>\n\n<p>The traditional approach was to reduce the thick concrete walls of the cave into hundreds of small blocks that could be handled by operators wearing air-fed suits.</p>\n\n<p>The Dounreay team decided to use a combination of diamond-track sawing and diamond-wire cutting to reduce the walls into a small number of huge blocks that could be lifted by crane and transported the short distance to the new LLW facility.</p>\n\n<p>This new approach was both cheaper and faster as well as significantly reducing secondary waste, the spread of contamination and the number of entries by operators wearing air-fed suits.</p>\n\n<p>The same approach was even used for the steel doors measuring 45cm thick and 26 tonnes, lifting them by crane through the roof of the facility.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"One of the 26-tonne doors,

buses, were consigned to the site’s LLW facility using this approach.</p>\n\n<p>A change in disposal options created the opportunity to simplify the decommissioning approach.</p>\n\n<h3
