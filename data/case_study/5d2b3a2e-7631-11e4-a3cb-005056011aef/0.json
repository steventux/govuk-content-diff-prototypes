{"title":"Hydroelectricity - Dinorwig Power Station, North Wales","public_updated_at":"2013-01-04T14:49:50Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>Dinorwig Power Station, located adjacent to the Snowdonia National Park in Gwynedd, North Wales, is Europeâ€™s largest pumped storage hydroelectric power station. It is also one of the fastest, most dynamic power plants in the world, capable of delivering its full station output of 1800 MW in only 12 seconds. This rapid response is strategically important to the GB electricity system in helping National Grid maintain the balance of supply and demand on a second-by-second basis across the network.</p>\n\n<p>The power station complex was built deep underground, inside the Elidir Mountain, and beneath the old Dinorwig slate quarry. It sits between an upper reservoir at the top of the mountain, and a lower reservoir, in the valley below. Water falling from the upper reservoir is used to drive turbo-generators that supply power to the grid. The water is discharged into the lower reservoir, and, during off-peak periods, pumped back into the upper reservoir for future use. It was commissioned in 1984 and took nearly 10 years to plan and construct.</p>\n\n<p>It is now owned by a joint venture of International Power plc (part of the GDF Suez group) and Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. This joint venture also owns a second, smaller pumped storage station at Ffestiniog, some 30 miles from Dinorwig.</p>\n</div>","change_history":[],"emphasised_organisations":["d65d4203-01f5-4920-a3b1-f614bfd8e83e"],"first_public_at":"2013-01-04T14:49:50+00:00","format_display_type":"case_study","image":{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/default_news_organisation_image_data/file/151/s300_department-of-energy-climate-change.jpg","alt_text":"placeholder","caption":null},"tags":{"browse_pages":[],"policies":["low-carbon-technologies"],"topics":[]}},"routes":[{"path":"/government/case-studies/hydroelectricity-dinorwig-power-station-north-wales","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"case_study","schema_name":"case_study","first_published_at":null,"base_path":"/government/case-studies/hydroelectricity-dinorwig-power-station-north-wales","description":"An example of pumped storage hydroelectric power","content_id":"5d2b3a2e-7631-11e4-a3cb-005056011aef","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"lead_organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"D11","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/department-of-energy-climate-change","base_path":"/government/organisations/department-of-energy-climate-change","content_id":"d65d4203-01f5-4920-a3b1-f614bfd8e83e","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-08-01T15:37:10Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Department of Energy & Climate Change","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"department-of-energy-climate-change","logo":{"formatted_title":"Department <br/>of Energy &amp;<br/>Climate Change","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}}],"related_policies":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/government/policies/low-carbon-technologies","base_path":"/government/policies/low-carbon-technologies","content_id":"5c7695d8-7631-11e4-a3cb-005056011aef","description":"","document_type":"policy","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-05-26T15:15:27Z","schema_name":"policy","title":"Low carbon technologies","withdrawn":false,"links":{}}],"available_translations":[{"title":"Hydroelectricity - Dinorwig Power Station, North Wales","public_updated_at":"2013-01-04T14:49:50Z","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"case_study","schema_name":"case_study","base_path":"/government/case-studies/hydroelectricity-dinorwig-power-station-north-wales","description":"An example of pumped storage hydroelectric power","api_path":"/api/content/government/case-studies/hydroelectricity-dinorwig-power-station-north-wales","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"5d2b3a2e-7631-11e4-a3cb-005056011aef","locale":"en"}]},"format":"case_study","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"other","government_document_supertype":"other","payload_version":0}
