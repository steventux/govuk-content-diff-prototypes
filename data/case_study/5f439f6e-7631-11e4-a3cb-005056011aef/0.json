{"title":"We helped Eduteq deliver a major education contract in Africa","public_updated_at":"2014-03-21T13:31:18Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>Leicestershire-based Eduteq won a major contract in Eritrea. They needed working capital solutions to allow them to deliver the contract and continue to grow. They looked to us for help and we provided support through our  <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bond-support-scheme-overview-and-how-to-apply\">Bond Support Scheme</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-working-capital-scheme-overview-and-how-to-apply\">Export Working Capital Schemes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Through providing support like this, we are <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-uk-s-exports-and-attracting-inward-investment/activity\">increasing the UK’s exports and making the UK more competitive</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"educational-services\">Educational services</h3>\n\n<p>Eduteq provides educational equipment and consultancy services to schools and vocational colleges in developing countries like Rwanda, Libya and Romania. The company can turn an empty room into a training workshop or a GCSE-level science classroom and had a turnover of £3.5 million in 2012.</p>\n\n<p>In January 2013 Eduteq won a £3.4 million contract to provide schools and colleges in Eritrea with training equipment and consultancy services. The client, the African Development Bank, needed a 10% performance bond before work could begin and although Eduteq could secure the bond itself, the £340,000 bond would leave the company unable to take on other work.</p>\n\n<p>Chris Foster, Operations Director at Eduteq said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">Our Eritrean contract is worth as much as our 2012 turnover. For each new contract we have to buy the equipment we need whilst looking for more work so we can grow. We’d have been taking too many risks by tying up our capital in this one bond. Our bank was unable to increase our working capital facility so we came to UK Export Finance for help.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Eduteq approached us for help in March 2013, and in April we agreed to guarantee half of the performance bond through our Bond Support Scheme, with the company’s bank guaranteeing the other half. UKEF also agreed to guarantee half of the bank’s working capital facility through its Export Working Capital Scheme, which enabled it to double the amount available to Eduteq.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of this help, Eduteq had enough working capital spare to start the Eritrean contract and to accept two new contracts in two new markets. The 12-strong company tripled its turnover in 2013 and is now looking for more work elsewhere in Africa and also South East Asia.</p>\n\n<p>Chris Foster, Operations Director at Eduteq said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">We’re able to look for more work than we could do before, because we know we have the finances to support it. We hope our turnover will grow to £14 million over the next three years.  One of the most visible benefits of UKEF’s help is that we’ve hired two new employees, and hopefully there’ll be more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"more-information-on-the-bond-support-scheme\">More information on the Bond Support Scheme</h3>\n\n<p>Under the Bond Support Scheme we provide a partial guarantee to a bank where it issues a bond in respect of a UK export contract. This protects the bank against the risk of the exporter being unable to repay them if a call is made on the bond by the beneficiary. The bank can then issue the bond even if it doesn’t have sufficient risk appetite. With advance payment and progress payment bonds, this may result in more working capital being available for the exporter.</p>\n\n<p>Criteria for eligibility are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>UK-based exporter</li>\n  <li>Buyer based overseas</li>\n  <li>Export goods and services need a minimum of 20% UK content</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We can typically guarantee up to 80% of the value of the bond.</p>\n\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bond-support-scheme-overview-and-how-to-apply\">full guide to the Bond Support Scheme</a>, including how to apply.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"more-information-on-the-export-working-capital-scheme\">More information on the Export Working Capital Scheme</h3>\n\n<p>The scheme assists UK exporters in gaining access to working capital finance (both pre and post-shipment) in respect of specific export contracts. Under the scheme, we provide partial guarantees to banks to cover the credit risks associated with export working capital facilities. Where a bank provides such a facility in respect of a UK export contract, we can typically guarantee 50% of the risk, although it may go up to 80% subject to detailed assessment.</p>\n\n<p>Criteria for eligibility are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>UK-based exporter</li>\n  <li>Buyer based overseas</li>\n  <li>Export goods and services need a minimum of 20% UK content</li>\n  <li>advances under the facility must be used to pay, or reimburse the exporter for payment of, expenses incurred in tendering for or performing that export contract</li>\n  <li>the maximum value of the working capital facility cannot be greater than 75% of the export contract’s value</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bond-support-scheme-overview-and-how-to-apply\">full guide to the Export Working Capital Scheme</a>, including how to apply.</p>\n\n<div class=\"contact \" id=\"contact_970\">\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <h3>New business enquiries</h3>\n\n    <div class=\"vcard contact-inner\">\n\n        <div class=\"email-url-number\">\n            <p class=\"email\">\n              <span class=\"type\">Email</span>\n              <a class=\"email\" href=\"mailto:customer.service@ukexportfinance.gov.uk\">customer.service@ukexportfinance.gov.uk</a>\n            </p>\n            <p class=\"tel\">\n              <span class=\"type\">Telephone</span>\n              020 7271 8010\n            </p>\n        </div>\n\n\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>","change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2014-03-21T13:31:18.000+00:00","note":"First published."}],"emphasised_organisations":["c4e41647-ad69-4e96-843b-05fa7867bbc0"],"first_public_at":"2014-03-21T13:29:54+00:00","format_display_type":"case_study","image":{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/23938/s300_eduteq-webpic1.jpg","alt_text":"people in a lab","caption":null},"tags":{"browse_pages":[],"policies":["exports-and-inward-investment"],"topics":[]}},"routes":[{"path":"/government/case-studies/we-helped-eduteq-deliver-a-major-education-contract-in-africa","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"case_study","schema_name":"case_study","first_published_at":"2016-02-29T09:24:10Z","base_path":"/government/case-studies/we-helped-eduteq-deliver-a-major-education-contract-in-africa","description":"UK Export Finance and Eduteq’s bank collaborated to help the company fund its largest ever contract and to take on more work for the future","content_id":"5f439f6e-7631-11e4-a3cb-005056011aef","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"lead_organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"D241","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/uk-export-finance","base_path":"/government/organisations/uk-export-finance","content_id":"c4e41647-ad69-4e96-843b-05fa7867bbc0","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2016-10-07T09:28:53Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"UK Export Finance","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"uk-export-finance","logo":{"formatted_title":"UK Export <br/>Finance","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}}],"related_policies":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/government/policies/exports-and-inward-investment","base_path":"/government/policies/exports-and-inward-investment","content_id":"5c765455-7631-11e4-a3cb-005056011aef","description":"","document_type":"policy","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-05-14T17:35:46Z","schema_name":"policy","title":"Exports and inward investment","withdrawn":false,"links":{}}],"world_locations":[{"analytics_identifier":"WL43","api_path":"/api/content/government/world/eritrea","base_path":"/government/world/eritrea","content_id":"5e9efc06-7706-11e4-a3cb-005056011aef","description":null,"document_type":"world_location","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2013-05-29T06:29:56Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Eritrea","withdrawn":false,"links":{}}]},"format":"case_study","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"other","government_document_supertype":"other","payload_version":0}
