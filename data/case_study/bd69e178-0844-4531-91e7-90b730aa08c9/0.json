For\nbroader human rights concerns relating to Iraq and Syria please\nsee their country of concern sections.</p>\n\n<p>2014 saw ISIL make substantial territorial gains in Iraq and Syria.\nThe UK government has been horrified by the brutality and\ninhumanity of ISIL, and the worsening humanitarian situation in\nIraq and Syria.</p>\n\n<p>ISIL fighters routinely use beatings or lashings, stoning,\namputations and crucifixions as punishments. There are numerous\nreports of murder, unlawful detention, sexual violence enforced\ndisappearances, and torture, inhuman and degrading treatment of\ncivilians, including children.</p>\n\n<p>ISIL uses extreme brutality to repress populations. There have\nbeen widespread reports of massacres against civilians, including\nof Yezidis and Christians in Mosul and Sunni tribesmen in western\nAnbar Province, both in Iraq, and mass executions in Ar-Raqqah\nand Homs in Syria. Mass graves have been discovered in Deir ez\nZour in Eastern Syria.</p>\n\n<p>ISIL routinely conduct executions, including of children. Residents\nare encouraged to attend and bodies are often displayed for days.\nThe UN Commission of Inquiry (COI) on Syria has said that there\nare “reasonable grounds to believe that [ISIL] has committed the\nwar crime of execution without due process”. Numbers are difficult\nto obtain or verify but the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has\ndocumented 1,175 executions of civilians by ISIL in Syria.</p>\n\n<p>ISIL have kidnapped and murdered hundreds of innocent people,\nincluding international journalists and humanitarian workers.</p>\n\n<p>Freedom of expression is severely restricted in ISIL-controlled areas.\nThe COI found that ISIL “systematically targeted sources of dissent”.\nISIL has attacked or imprisoned those who speak out, or do not\nadhere to the group’s ideology. Journalists have been abducted\nand killed and Reporters Without Borders say ISIL-controlled areas\nare now media “black-holes”.</p>\n\n<p>ISIL routinely persecute human rights activists, including Sameera\nSalih Ali al-Nuaimy, an Iraqi human rights lawyer, who was\nabducted, tortured, and publicly executed in Mosul.</p>\n\n<p>ISIL has imposed a twisted interpretation of Sharia law, enforced\nby its Al-Hisbah morality police. The COI found that harsh penalties\nare summarily meted out on the principle of “guilty until proven\ninnocent” and detainees “have no access to lawyers and are\nafforded none of the due process rights inherent in a fair trial”.\nPunishments, including lashings, execution and crucifixion, are\noften carried out publicly as a deterrent.</p>\n\n<p>ISIL’s attacks on civilians are not just confined to Iraq and Syria. In\naddition to attacks in the region, attacks have also taken place in\nEurope, Australia and Canada, including the first attack in Europe\nwhich took place in Brussels in May, killing four people. While the\nextent of ISIL’s involvement is yet to be determined, it is clear that\nthese attacks were ISIL-inspired, and that at least one was carried\nout by an ISIL returnee from Syria.</p>\n\n<p>Minorities in Iraq and Syria – including Christians, Turkmen\nShi’a, Yezidis and Kurds – have been systematically targeted by\nISIL, placing the long-term survival of some communities at risk.\nAmnesty International reported that ISIL has carried out ethnic\ncleansing “on a historic scale” in Iraq. The COI noted ISIL’s targeting\nof minorities has forced communities to assimilate or flee. ISIL\nenforce their ideology strictly and brutally. There have been\nwidespread reports of minorities being pressured to convert to\nIslam or risk execution. ISIL fighters have also destroyed sites holy\nto non-Sunni Muslims in both Iraq and Syria.</p>\n\n<p>Women and girls have seen their freedom appallingly restricted\nby ISIL. Women have been banned from public life and those who\ndo not adhere to ISIL’s strict rules risk brutal punishment, including\nlashings and stoning. There have been widespread reports of\nwomen and girls, including several thousand Yezidis in northern\nIraq, being abducted by ISIL fighters, subjected to forced marriage,\nrape and other sexual violence, and sold into slavery. Displaced\nwomen and girls are also vulnerable in and outside internally\ndisplaced persons (IDP) camps. They are exposed to increased\nlevels of domestic violence as well as sexual harassment, organised\nprostitution, and sex trafficking.</p>\n\n<p>Children have been indoctrinated by ISIL in school and trained\nas child soldiers. There are reports of children being used as\nexecutioners, checkpoint guards and suicide bombers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"uk-action\">UK action</h3>\n<p>The UK condemns the brutal human rights abuses perpetrated\nby ISIL fighters, and is committed to defeating ISIL through a\ncomprehensive and sustained international strategy, as part of the\nefforts of the global anti-ISIL coalition. In Iraq, the UK is working\nclosely with regional, US, European and other partners to defeat\nISIL in Iraq and Syria, and to help prevent and manage the impact\nof ISIL on the region, particularly in Lebanon and Jordan. And, at\nhome, we are taking action to prevent attacks and identify those\nwho are planning them.</p>\n\n<p>Cutting off ISIL’s access to funding and foreign fighters is key\nto defeating ISIL. We have led efforts to reinforce sanctions\nagainst those who try to recruit fighters, and strongly supported\nmultilateral initiatives including UN Security Council Resolutions\n(UNSCRs) 2170 and 2178. UNSCR 2170, a UK initiative, was\nadopted unanimously in August 2014, condemning ISIL, the Al-\nNusra Front (ANF) and other terrorist groups listed under Al Qaeda\nsanctions. In Iraq, UK airstrikes, surveillance and support to the\nIraqi Security Forces and the Peshmerga forces have contributed\nto halting the advance of ISIL and its brutal practices. The UK cosponsored\nthe resolution passed by the UN Human Rights Council\non 1 September, which highlighted ISIL’s abhorrent actions, and\ncommitted to a fact-finding mission to Iraq to investigate these\natrocities. The mission’s findings will be discussed in March 2015.\nWe have called for the situation in Syria to be referred to the\nInternational Criminal Court and supported a UNSC resolution to\nthat effect in May, which was vetoed by Russia and China.</p>\n\n<p>We have pledged £700 million in aid to Syria and the region. The\nDepartment for International Development is supporting partners\nto protect and support survivors of sexual and gender-based\nviolence. We are also working with the Canadian government to\nbuild the capacity of Iraqi organisations to prevent and respond to\nsexual violence.</p>\n\n<p>In both Iraq and Syria, we will continue to look at every available\noption to ensure accountability, and to work with our international\npartners on what can be done both to assist the victims and\nto bring those responsible to justice. We will work closely with\ncoalition partners to continue the international fight against ISIL.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"this-case-study-is-part-of-the-2014-human-rights-and-democracy-reporthttpswwwgovukgovernmentpublicationshuman-rights-and-democracy-report-2014human-rights-and-democracy-report-2014\">This case study is part of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/human-rights-and-democracy-report-2014/human-rights-and-democracy-report-2014\">2014 Human Rights and Democracy Report</a>.</h4>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.hrdreport.fco.gov.uk/case-study-freedom-of-religion-or-belief-in-south-east-asia\">Submit a question or comment on the report</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>","format_display_type":"case_study","first_public_at":"2015-03-12T09:30:00.000+00:00","change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2015-03-12T09:30:00.000+00:00","note":"Added translation"}],"emphasised_organisations":["9adfc4ed-9f6c-4976-a6d8-18d34356367c"],"image":{"url":"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/default_news_organisation_image_data/file/102/s300_Main-building-gov.uk.jpg","alt_text":"placeholder","caption":null}},"routes":[{"path":"/government/case-studies/thematic-case-study-isil","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"case_study","schema_name":"case_study","first_published_at":"2016-02-29T09:24:10Z","base_path":"/government/case-studies/thematic-case-study-isil","description":"A case study from the 2014 Human Rights and Democracy Report.
