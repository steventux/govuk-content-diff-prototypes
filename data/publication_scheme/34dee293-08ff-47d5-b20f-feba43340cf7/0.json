The Civil Nuclear Police Authority is subject to the Act.</p>\n\n<p>In developing its publication scheme, the Police Authority wishes to follow the spirit of the National Police Chiefs’ Council (<abbr title=\"National Police Chiefs' Council\">NPCC</abbr>) model publication scheme, which is currently being reviewed by the <abbr title=\"National Police Chiefs' Council\">NPCC</abbr> and the Information Commissioners Office. While the outcome of this review is awaited, the Police Authority has chosen to publish information under a number of the information classes presently offered to the general public.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"requests-received-in-welsh\">Requests received in Welsh</h2>\n<p>Upon receiving a request in Welsh under the Freedom of Information Act, we will provide an acknowledgement in both Welsh and English.</p>\n\n<p>As the Civil Nuclear Police Authority does not have a dedicated professional Welsh language translation service internally, the first action upon receiving a request will be to approach our external Welsh language translation service and pay for a translation. The official response will also be bilingual.</p>\n\n<p>Any additional communications made during this process will be made in English as we are working within a constrained deadline and we wish to respond within the 20 working days permitted.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"who-we-are-and-what-we-do\">Who we are and what we do</h2>\n<p>The Civil Nuclear Constabulary (<abbr title=\"Civil Nuclear Constabulary\">CNC</abbr>) has a very exclusive role.
