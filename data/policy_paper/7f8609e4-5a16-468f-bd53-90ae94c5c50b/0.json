{"title":"Selective overcompensation in the Capacity Market","public_updated_at":"2016-09-27T09:06:42Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>In March 2016, the Government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/letter-between-amber-rudd-and-national-grid-about-the-2016-t-4-auction-the-early-capacity-auction-and-the-dsr-transitional-auction\">consulted</a> on an exclusion from future CM auctions of projects that have used investment through risk finance schemes. In our response to this consultation, however, we noted that an outright exclusion may create risks to auction liquidity. We therefore now propose to offset investment received through risk finance schemes and spent on prospective capacity, from Capacity Market payments.  This will ensure that those projects that have not had support through a risk finance scheme are able to compete fairly.</p>\n</div>","change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2016-09-27T10:06:42.000+01:00","note":"First published."}],"documents":["<section class=\"attachment embedded\" id=\"attachment_1734653\">\n  <div class=\"attachment-thumb\">\n      <a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/555592/Selective_overcompensation_in_the_CM_-_detail.pdf\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/555592/thumbnail_Selective_overcompensation_in_the_CM_-_detail.pdf.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"attachment-details\">\n    <h2 class=\"title\"><a aria-describedby=\"attachment-1734653-accessibility-help\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/555592/Selective_overcompensation_in_the_CM_-_detail.pdf\">Selective overcompensation in the Capacity Market - detail</a></h2>\n    <p class=\"metadata\">\n        <span class=\"type\"><abbr title=\"Portable Document Format\">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class=\"file-size\">109KB</span>, <span class=\"page-length\">6 pages</span>\n    </p>\n\n\n      <div data-module=\"toggle\" class=\"accessibility-warning\" id=\"attachment-1734653-accessibility-help\">\n        <h2>This file may not be suitable for users of assistive technology.\n          <a class=\"toggler\" href=\"#attachment-1734653-accessibility-request\" data-controls=\"attachment-1734653-accessibility-request\" data-expanded=\"false\">Request an accessible format.</a>\n        </h2>\n        <p id=\"attachment-1734653-accessibility-request\" class=\"js-hidden\">\n          If you use assistive technology (eg a screen reader) and need a\nversion of this document in a more accessible format, please email <a href=\"mailto:?body=Details%20of%20document%20required%3A%0A%0A%20%20Title%3A%20Selective%20overcompensation%20in%20the%20Capacity%20Market%20-%20detail%0A%20%20Original%20format%3A%20pdf%0A%0APlease%20tell%20us%3A%0A%0A%20%201.%20What%20makes%20this%20format%20unsuitable%20for%20you%3F%0A%20%202.%20What%20format%20you%20would%20prefer%3F%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;subject=Request%20for%20%27Selective%20overcompensation%20in%20the%20Capacity%20Market%20-%20detail%27%20in%20an%20alternative%20format\"></a>.\nPlease tell us what format you need.
