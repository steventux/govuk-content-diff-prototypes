Check their websites for details.\r\n\r\n###Fees for child maintenance cases\r\n\r\nYou have to pay the test fee of £258.60 if the Child Maintenance Service asks you to get a test because they think you might be the parent. It’ll be refunded if the test shows that you're not the parent. \r\n\r\nThe fee will be higher if more than one child is tested.\r\n\r\n^The Child Maintenance Service may pay the test fee if you can't afford to pay it. You'll have to pay it back if you're proved to be the parent.^\r\n\r\n##If someone refuses a DNA test\r\n\r\nThe person carrying out the test can only take a DNA sample if they have permission from either:\r\n\r\n* the person being tested, if they're an adult \r\n* someone with parental responsibility, if the person being tested is under 16\r\n\r\nYou can ask the court to accept your claim about who someone’s parents are. This is called [applying for a declaration of parentage](http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=2631). The court might decide to order a DNA test. \r\n\r\nIt costs £365 to apply - make your cheque payable to 'HM Courts and Tribunals Service'. You may be able to get a [fee exemption or refund](/get-help-with-court-fees ).\r\n\r\nSend the form and fee to the [family court](https://courttribunalfinder.service.gov.uk/search/) nearest to the home of the person whose parents are being tested. \r\n\r\n*[CSA]: Child Support Agency"},{"content_type":"text/html","content":"<p>A DNA test can be used to either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>prove that 2 people definitely aren’t related</li>\n  <li>show the probability (up to 99.99%) that 2 people are related</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You’ll need to give either a blood or saliva sample.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-you-can-use-a-dna-test-for\">What you can use a DNA test for</h2>\n\n<p>DNA tests can be used to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>solve a dispute about child maintenance</li>\n  <li>apply for contact with a child</li>\n  <li>apply for a visa so that a child can settle with you in the UK</li>\n  <li>find out who inherits an estate when someone has died</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can arrange a DNA test yourself.
