These notices concerned Riata and Riata ST ICD leads (manufactured by SJM) that were experiencing abrasion of silicone, leading to the externalization of cables.  Whilst screening these patients the same failure mechanism was observed in a small number of QuickFlex/Quicksite leads implanted to provide additional CRT.  The potential clinical consequences of these lead failures is significantly less serious than for the Riata leads as there is no risk of loss of high voltage ICD therapy. SJM has stated that they do not manufacture any other leads which could fail in this manner.  </p>\n\n<p>Although the prevalence of confirmed cases of externalized cables among QuickFlex/Quicksite leads is currently low (0.023%) a preliminary assessment by the manufacturer estimates that externalized conductors may be present in 3–4% of the patient population. To date there have been no reports of electrical failure or patient harm associated with externalization of Quicksite/Quickflex leads.  Externalized cables have been found to continue to function normally due to their inner protective ETFE coating. If, however, the inner coating were to be breached and the system failed to provide alternative pacing therapy, biventricular pacing/CRT therapy could be lost. This could give rise to reduced heart pumping efficiency, reduced ejection fraction, and ultimately an exacerbation of heart failure.  </p>\n\n<p>Approximately 6,000 Quickflex/Quicksite leads have been distributed in the UK since they were first placed on the market in 2004.  There have been 2 reports of externalized cables in the UK.  </p>\n\n<p>An example of an externalized cable is shown below. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/media/5485ac03ed915d4c1000027d/con149819.jpg\" alt=\"Left ventricular cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) lead - externalized\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"action\">Action</h2>\n\n<p>In line with the advice in St Jude Medical’s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/media/5485ac02e5274a428d000271/con149684.pdf\">Field Safety Notice</a>:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Do not implant affected bipolar QuickSite or QuickFlex lead models.  </li>\n  <li>Quarantine any affected devices and return them to the manufacturer.  </li>\n  <li>Identify all patients implanted with an affected device and arrange for an early follow-up to take place within 3 months.  </li>\n  <li>Ensure alerts that monitor lead impedance changes outside of the nominal range are programmed and patient alerts are turned on.  </li>\n  <li>Review lead performance at 3-monthly intervals following your own standard procedures (see further advice below).  </li>\n  <li>Consider the need for further examination e.g. by ECG or fluoroscopy*, if a lead failure is suspected.  </li>\n  <li>Prophylactic replacement of these devices is not recommended except in exceptional circumstances.  </li>\n  <li>Ensure all patients are enrolled on remote monitoring where possible in discussion with St Jude Medical.  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>*In all cases, the benefit of fluoroscopic screening should be weighed against the risks from radiation exposure on an individual patient basis, in line with the requirements of the Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure) Regulations 2000.</p>\n\n<p>Further advice  </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>At follow-up:<br />\n(i) monitor LV lead impedance and threshold<br />\n(ii) consider the possibility of LV lead failure in the event of heart failure deterioration<br />\n(iii) full use should be made of remote follow-up to monitor LV lead performance<br />\n(iv) remind patients of the importance of contacting their follow-up clinic as soon as possible in the event of any patient alert.  </li>\n  <li>Ensure that the replacement device has remote/advanced monitoring capabilities if a decision is made to continue to use the lead at routine pulse generator replacement.  </li>\n  <li>If evidence of a protruding conductor is found, the risks and benefits of lead replacement should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in discussion with the patient.  </li>\n  <li>Report all adverse incidents involving these leads to the MHRA and to St Jude Medical.  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"action-by\">Action by</h2>\n\n<p>All cardiologists and cardiac physiologists who manage patients implanted with CRT leads.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"distribution\">Distribution</h2>\n\n<p>This MDA has been sent to:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>NHS trusts in England (chief executives)  </li>\n  <li>Care Quality Commission (CQC) (headquarters) for information  </li>\n  <li>HSC trusts in Northern Ireland (chief executives)  </li>\n  <li>NHS boards and trusts in Wales (chief executives)  </li>\n  <li>NHS boards in Scotland (equipment coordinators)  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"onward-distribution\">Onward distribution</h4>\n\n<p>Please bring this notice to the attention of relevant employees in your establishment.
