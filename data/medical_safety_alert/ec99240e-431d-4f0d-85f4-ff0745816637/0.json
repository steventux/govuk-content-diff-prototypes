The syringe label includes the graduated volume markings.</p>\n\n<p>Pre-filled syringes from the affected batches should be used with caution.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/media/5485abaaed915d4c1000023f/con267918.jpg\" alt=\"Class 4 Drug Alert (Caution in Use): Aurum Pharmaceuticals Limited (trading as Martindale Pharma) - Adrenaline (Epinephrine) Injection, Amiodarone Injection, Ephedrine Hydrochloride Injection - EL 13(A)13\" /></p>\n\n<p>The syringe in the top position has the label in the correct position.  </p>\n\n<p>The syringe in the lower position has the label applied too close to the end of the barrel and should be used with caution.</p>\n\n<p>The implication of this misalignment is that incorrect dosing could occur if the entire contents of the syringe are not used. For example if a dose was titrated between the intermediate and completely empty position.</p>\n\n<p>The fill-volume and total dose in the syringe is correct. It may appear that there is over-fill of the syringe. Do not discard what appears to be excess before administration.</p>\n\n<p>This issue has been corrected by the manufacturer however this issue may be present within the market for a period of time.</p>\n\n<p>Recipients of this drug alert should bring it to the attention of relevant contacts by copy of this letter. Local area teams are asked to forward this to relevant clinics, general practitioners and community pharmacists for information.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"download-documents\">Download documents</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/media/5485aba9e5274a4290000265/con267920.pdf\"> Class 4 Drug Alert (Caution in Use): Aurum Pharmaceuticals Limited (trading as Martindale Pharma) - Adrenaline (Epinephrine) Injection 1:10,000 1mg/10ml, Amiodarone Injection 30mg/ml, Ephedrine Hydrochloride Injection 3mg/ml - EL 13(A)13 (448Kb)</a></li>\n</ul>\n","change_history":[],"headers":[{"id":"product-details","level":2,"text":"Product details"},{"id":"download-documents","level":2,"text":"Download documents"}],"metadata":{"alert_type":"drugs","bulk_published":true,"document_type":"medical_safety_alert","issued_date":"2013-04-29","medical_specialism":["pharmacy"]}},"routes":[{"path":"/drug-device-alerts/drug-alert-adrenaline-epinephrine-injection-1-10-000-1mg-10ml-amiodarone-injection-30mg-ml-ephedrine-hydrochloride-injection-3mg-ml-misalignment-of-syringe-label","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"specialist-publisher","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"medical_safety_alert","schema_name":"placeholder_specialist_document","first_published_at":"2016-02-29T09:24:10Z","base_path":"/drug-device-alerts/drug-alert-adrenaline-epinephrine-injection-1-10-000-1mg-10ml-amiodarone-injection-30mg-ml-ephedrine-hydrochloride-injection-3mg-ml-misalignment-of-syringe-label","description":"(Aurum Pharmaceuticals Limited (trading as Martindale Pharma)) Pre-filled syringes from affected batches should be used with caution.– class 3 action within 5 days.
