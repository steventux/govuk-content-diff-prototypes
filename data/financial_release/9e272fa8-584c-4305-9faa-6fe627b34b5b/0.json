People applying for investments of less than £1,000 will be prioritised.\n\nAll proceeds from share sales are used to pay down the national debt.\n\nMilitary personnel and their spouses stationed overseas will be able to participate in the sale, where possible. This is in line with the government’s armed forces covenant, which ensures that members of the armed forces should not face disadvantage in the provision of public services.\n\nHM Treasury has also launched a dedicated campaign webpage for potential investors, where members of the public can pre-register and receive email updates about the sale.
