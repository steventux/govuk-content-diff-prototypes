Mr Hill brings a wealth of experience and legal expertise to help deliver this.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"last-child\">I am grateful to David Anderson QC for his service as Independent Reviewer and thank him for his considered reports and valuable analysis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Max Hill QC said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p class=\"last-child\">I am very pleased to have this opportunity, which comes at a time of heightened concern about the risk from terrorism which we all face in the UK. As a practising barrister with experience in both counter-terrorism and the rights of citizens facing allegations of serious crime, I look forward to working with participants at all levels and from all sides.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As part of his role, Mr Hill will be required to provide an annual report on his findings, which the government must lay before Parliament and publish.
