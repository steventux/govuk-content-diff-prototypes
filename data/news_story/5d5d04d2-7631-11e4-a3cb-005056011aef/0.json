{"title":"Teenagers asked 'Would you see rape?' as ad campaign goes live","public_updated_at":"2012-03-01T00:00:00Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>With 33 per cent of teenage girls and 16 per cent of boys reporting that they have experienced some form of sexual violence from a boyfriend or girlfriend, the campaign aims to help teenagers recognise unacceptable behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>The adverts are aimed at 13 to 18-year-olds and feature a teenage girl being coerced into sex. They will run for a month on youth TV channels, as well as in cinemas and online.</p>\n\n<p>Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone, who launched the campaign today with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, said: ’Teenagers are inundated with information about relationships, from their friends, the internet and TV, so that knowing what’s actually acceptable can be really difficult.</p>\n\n<p>‘This campaign aims to dispel the myths that can lead to acceptance of rape in relationships. Bringing the issue out in the open will help teenagers feel confident about challenging abuse when they see it and ultimately protect potential victims.’</p>\n\n<p>The adverts point teenagers towards a website designed specifically for them, where they can find information, seek help and share experiences with their peers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"youtubehttpwwwhomeofficegovukstaticcorporateimagespnglogoyoutubepng\"><img src=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk//static/corporate/images/png/logo_youtube.png\" alt=\"Youtube\"></h2>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/media-centre/video-transcripts/teenage-rape-prevention-campaign/\">Transcript for Teenage rape prevention campaign</a></p>\n</div>","emphasised_organisations":["06056197-bc69-4147-aa28-070bca132178"],"image":{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/default_news_organisation_image_data/file/153/s300_home-office.jpg","caption":null,"alt_text":"placeholder"},"first_public_at":"2012-03-01T00:00:00.000+00:00","political":true,"government":{"title":"2010 to 2015 Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government","slug":"2010-to-2015-conservative-and-liberal-democrat-coalition-government","current":false},"tags":{"browse_pages":[],"policies":["violence-against-women-and-girls"],"topics":[]}},"routes":[{"path":"/government/news/teenagers-asked-would-you-see-rape-as-ad-campaign-goes-live","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"news_story","schema_name":"news_article","first_published_at":"2012-03-01T00:00:00Z","base_path":"/government/news/teenagers-asked-would-you-see-rape-as-ad-campaign-goes-live","description":"A powerful new TV advertising campaign challenging teenagers to re-think their views of what constitutes rape and consent.","content_id":"5d5d04d2-7631-11e4-a3cb-005056011aef","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"available_translations":[{"title":"Teenagers asked 'Would you see rape?' as ad campaign goes live","public_updated_at":"2012-03-01T00:00:00Z","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"news_story","schema_name":"news_article","base_path":"/government/news/teenagers-asked-would-you-see-rape-as-ad-campaign-goes-live","description":"A powerful new TV advertising campaign challenging teenagers to re-think their views of what constitutes rape and consent.","api_path":"/api/content/government/news/teenagers-asked-would-you-see-rape-as-ad-campaign-goes-live","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"5d5d04d2-7631-11e4-a3cb-005056011aef","locale":"en"}]},"format":"news_article","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"announcements","government_document_supertype":"news-stories","payload_version":0}
