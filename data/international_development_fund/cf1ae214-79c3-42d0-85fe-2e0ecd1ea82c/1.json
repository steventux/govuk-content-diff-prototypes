Its absence allows an environment in which corruption can flourish and citizens are unable to assess the decisions of their leaders or make informed choices about who they elect to serve as their representatives.</p>\n\n<p>Thirty-eight organisations were selected for funding in 2008. Their activities covered a wide range of governance issues and were linked to around 1,000 local organisations in over 100 countries. </p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Governance and Transparency Fund\">GTF</abbr> helped increase the voice of ordinary citizens around the world. It assisted local organisations such as the National Taxpayers Association to improve access to education in rural communities by monitoring local government spending on school construction in Kenya. It also enabled international organisations like Amnesty International, Global Witness and Water Aid to work with civil society partners on issues concerning human rights, natural resource management and access to basic services for disadvantaged communities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-apply\">How to apply</h2>\n<p>All funding decisions have been taken and there are no plans to issue any further calls
