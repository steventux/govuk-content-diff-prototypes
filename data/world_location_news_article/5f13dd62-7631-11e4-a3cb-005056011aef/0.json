{"title":"Joint Stattement on the protection of the heritage of Alexandria","public_updated_at":"2014-02-16T13:17:00Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>Alexandria is a city of unique historical background. Its great history lies in every corner and in every step of its ancient streets and its unique identity has been eternally depicted on its historical buildings. Buildings of different styles and architectural trends reflecting and reminding of the true multi-cultural spirit that has always prevailed in this city bringing together people of different nationalities, languages, religions. Buildings of unparalleled beauty and character that gave to Alexandria international fame and have always attracted great numbers of visitors.</p>\n\n<p>These architectural treasures deserve to be kept and protected. Not only as a sign of respect for the past but, primarily, as a legacy for the future and the coming generations. Alexandria’s rich cultural heritage has the potential to be an important driver of much-needed economic growth and urban regeneration. It should be a source of pride, not conflict, in the local community.</p>\n\n<p>In this framework, we called on HE the Governor of Alexandria, Major General Tariq Mahdi, on 12 February to express our support for the aspirations of the people of Alexandria to protect their cultural heritage. We commended the efforts of the Governor and all those involved in trying to prevent the demolition of historic buildings, especially – but not exclusively – those which were originally listed as protected cultural heritage of the city. We also  discussed possible areas of future co-operation, including ways in which the international community can help Alexandrians to protect their beautiful city.</p>\n</div>","change_history":[],"image":{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/22272/s300_FCO.jpg","alt_text":"Foreign & Commonwealth","caption":"Foreign & Commonwealth Office"},"political":true,"government":{"title":"2010 to 2015 Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government","slug":"2010-to-2015-conservative-and-liberal-democrat-coalition-government","current":false},"tags":{"browse_pages":[],"policies":[],"topics":[]},"first_public_at":"2014-02-16T13:17:00.000+00:00"},"routes":[{"path":"/government/world-location-news/joint-stattement-on-the-protection-of-the-heritage-of-alexandria","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"world_location_news_article","schema_name":"world_location_news_article","first_published_at":"2014-02-16T13:17:00Z","base_path":"/government/world-location-news/joint-stattement-on-the-protection-of-the-heritage-of-alexandria","description":"Consuls General of United Kingdom, France and Greece express support for the aspirations to protect the cultural heritage of Alexandria","content_id":"5f13dd62-7631-11e4-a3cb-005056011aef","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"available_translations":[{"title":"بيان مشترك من القناصل العامة لكل من المملكة المتحدة و فرنسا و اليونان بشأن حماية تراث الإسكندرية","public_updated_at":"2014-02-16T13:17:00Z","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"world_location_news_article","schema_name":"world_location_news_article","base_path":"/government/world-location-news/joint-stattement-on-the-protection-of-the-heritage-of-alexandria.ar","description":"يؤكد القناصل العامة لكل من المملكة المتحدة و فرنسا و اليونان على دعمهم لمطالب الشعب السكندري في حماية تراثه الثقافي","api_path":"/api/content/government/world-location-news/joint-stattement-on-the-protection-of-the-heritage-of-alexandria.ar","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"5f13dd62-7631-11e4-a3cb-005056011aef","locale":"ar"},{"title":"Joint Stattement on the protection of the heritage of Alexandria","public_updated_at":"2014-02-16T13:17:00Z","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"world_location_news_article","schema_name":"world_location_news_article","base_path":"/government/world-location-news/joint-stattement-on-the-protection-of-the-heritage-of-alexandria","description":"Consuls General of United Kingdom, France and Greece express support for the aspirations to protect the cultural heritage of Alexandria","api_path":"/api/content/government/world-location-news/joint-stattement-on-the-protection-of-the-heritage-of-alexandria","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"5f13dd62-7631-11e4-a3cb-005056011aef","locale":"en"}]},"format":"world_location_news_article","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"other","government_document_supertype":"other","payload_version":0}
