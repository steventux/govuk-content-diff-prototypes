However the sector is at high risk from corruption given the value of contracts involved: estimated global spend amounts to over US$9.5 trillion each year, equivalent to 15% of global GDP.\nSignificant progress has already been made in publishing public procurement data across the region. To support these efforts, the UK government seeks to work with countries in West Africa that are committed to applying greater transparency in all or parts of the public contracting cycle: planning, tender, award, contract and implementation. Increased transparency in this sector will create fairer competition for business, especially smaller firms; drive higher-quality goods, works, and services for citizens and help to prevent fraud and corruption. It will also help level the playing field for international competition in the award of public contracts.</p>\n\n<p>The study will:</p>\n\n<p>A. Assess current levels of transparency in public procurement across the region; B. Identify key stakeholders and their capacities and enthusiasm for advancing this agenda; C. Recommend how the UK government can work with stakeholders to apply greater transparency to parts or all of the public contracting cycle.</p>\n\n<p>Target countries for the study include Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Senegal, Cameroon, Guinea and Liberia. We welcome proposals that cover at least three of these target countries.</p>\n\n<p>Please read the instructions on the tendering procedures carefully as failure to comply may invalidate your Tender. All Tender documentation will be published, and all substantive communication between the Authority and bidders will be conducted via this email address, AddisAbaba.projects@fco.gov.uk</p>\n\n<p>Your Tender must be submitted electronically to AddisAbaba.projects@fco.gov.uk by 12:00 UK Time / 11:00 Ghana Time, 1st July 2016. Tenders not submitted via AddisAbaba.projects@fco.gov.uk will not be considered.</p>\n\n<section class=\"attachment embedded\" id=\"attachment_1595330\">\n  <div class=\"attachment-thumb\">\n      <a
