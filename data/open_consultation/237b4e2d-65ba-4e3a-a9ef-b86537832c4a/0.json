{"title":"Draft legislation: the Corporate Interest Restriction (Financial Statements: Group Mismatches) Regulations 2017","public_updated_at":"2017-05-10T14:24:08Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>The Corporate Interest Restriction (<abbr title=\"Corporate Interest Restriction\">CIR</abbr>) legislation was included in Schedule 10 of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/finance-bill-2017-legislation-and-explanatory-notes\">Finance Bill 2017</a> but has now been removed. There has been no policy change and the government has announced it will legislate for the provisions at the earliest opportunity in the next Parliament.</p>\n\n<p>A consultation on how the <abbr title=\"Corporate Interest Restriction\">CIR</abbr> rules should operate was opened in May 2016 and the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/574318/tax_deductability_consultation_response_final.pdf\">governmentâ€™s response</a> to this was published in December 2016.</p>\n\n<p>Regulations are needed to ensure the interaction of the rules with accounting standards does not give an unwarranted restriction on commencement of the <abbr title=\"Corporate Interest Restriction\">CIR</abbr>. In particular, they deal with timing differences between the group and entity accounts when applying the fixed ratio debt cap and also for the group ratio method for highly leveraged groups.</p>\n\n<p>HM Revenue and Customs has published draft regulations, together with a draft explanatory memorandum, for a period of consultation which will close on 26 May 2017.</p>\n\n<p>Any comments on these drafts should be made to Oli Jones.</p>\n\n<p>Telephone: 03000 541970<br>\nEmail: <a
