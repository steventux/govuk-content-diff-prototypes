On 31 March 2018 this national contract ends and the department must put new arrangements in place from 1 April 2018.</p>\n\n<p>The end of this contract provides the department an opportunity, by 2018, to transform the way it does business by using the estate in the most efficient and cost effective way. This will represent value for money for the taxpayer and deliver a flexible, high standard service to our customers. A number of our sites are near each other and it makes good sense to plan a more efficient service delivery approach.</p>\n\n</div>","closing_date":"2017-02-28T17:00:00.000+00:00","emphasised_organisations":["b548a09f-8b35-4104-89f4-f1a40bf3136d"],"opening_date":"2017-01-30T09:30:00.000+00:00","change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2017-01-30T09:30:03.000+00:00","note":"First published."}],"documents":["<section class=\"attachment embedded\" id=\"attachment_1932752\">\n  <div class=\"attachment-thumb\">\n      <a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/587710/consultation-on-a-proposal-for-the-future-of-hoylake-jobcentre.pdf\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/587710/thumbnail_consultation-on-a-proposal-for-the-future-of-hoylake-jobcentre.pdf.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"attachment-details\">\n    <h2 class=\"title\"><a aria-describedby=\"attachment-1932752-accessibility-help\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/587710/consultation-on-a-proposal-for-the-future-of-hoylake-jobcentre.pdf\">Proposal for the future of Hoylake Jobcentre</a></h2>\n    <p class=\"metadata\">\n        <span class=\"type\"><abbr title=\"Portable Document Format\">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class=\"file-size\">115KB</span>, <span class=\"page-length\">10 pages</span>\n    </p>\n\n\n      <div data-module=\"toggle\" class=\"accessibility-warning\" id=\"attachment-1932752-accessibility-help\">\n        <h2>This file may not be suitable for users of assistive technology.\n          <a class=\"toggler\" href=\"#attachment-1932752-accessibility-request\" data-controls=\"attachment-1932752-accessibility-request\" data-expanded=\"false\">Request an accessible format.</a>\n        </h2>\n        <p id=\"attachment-1932752-accessibility-request\" class=\"js-hidden\">\n          If you use assistive technology (such as a screen reader) and need a\nversion of this document in a more accessible format, please email <a href=\"mailto:accessible.formats@dwp.gsi.gov.uk?body=Details%20of%20document%20required%3A%0A%0A%20%20Title%3A%20Proposal%20for%20the%20future%20of%20Hoylake%20Jobcentre%0A%20%20Original%20format%3A%20pdf%0A%0APlease%20tell%20us%3A%0A%0A%20%201.%20What%20makes%20this%20format%20unsuitable%20for%20you%3F%0A%20%202.%20What%20format%20you%20would%20prefer%3F%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;subject=Request%20for%20%27Proposal%20for%20the%20future%20of%20Hoylake%20Jobcentre%27%20in%20an%20alternative%20format\">accessible.formats@dwp.gsi.gov.uk</a>.\nPlease tell us what format you need.
