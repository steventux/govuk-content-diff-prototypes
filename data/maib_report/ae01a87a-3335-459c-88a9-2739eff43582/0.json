The master had conduct of the vessel, and was assisted on the bridge by the chief officer. The grounding occurred within the port limits and resulted from the ship being set out of the narrow navigable channel by the wind and swell, shortly after the harbour pilot had disembarked. </p>\n\n<p>Although initial attempts to re-float the ship using a local lifeboat and tug were unsuccessful, she was eventually re-floated on 4 January 2007 after her bunkers and about 500t of her timber cargo was removed. The ship was then towed back to Montrose for survey. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"action-taken\">Action taken</h3>\n\n<p>The Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has written to the:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>port authority, strongly advising that it reviews its pilotage directions and risk assessments related to the safety of navigation, paying particular attention to the position of pilot disembarkation and the manoeuvrability of vessels.   </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>ship’s owner, strongly advising that he ensure that the ship’s masters are aware of the manoeuvring characteristics of the vessel, including the power output of the main engine, and that passage planning and onboard instructions are sufficiently detailed.  </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Antigua &amp; Barbuda Register, advising it to obtain independent verification of the power output of the ship’s main engine, and to ensure that the correct output is used on all appropriate documentation.   </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n","change_history":[],"headers":[{"headers":[{"id":"synopsis","level":3,"text":"Synopsis"},{"id":"action-taken","level":3,"text":"Action taken"}],"id":"completed-pe-summary-emsland","level":2,"text":"Completed PE Summary: Emsland"}],"metadata":{"bulk_published":true,"date_of_occurrence":"2006-12-29","document_type":"maib_report","report_type":"completed-preliminary-examination","vessel_type":["merchant-vessel-100-gross-tons-or-over"]}},"routes":[{"path":"/maib-reports/grounding-of-general-cargo-vessel-emsland-off-montrose-scotland","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"specialist-publisher","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"maib_report","schema_name":"placeholder_specialist_document","first_published_at":"2016-02-29T09:24:10Z","base_path":"/maib-reports/grounding-of-general-cargo-vessel-emsland-off-montrose-scotland","description":"Location: Departing the Port of Montrose, Scotland.","content_id":"ae01a87a-3335-459c-88a9-2739eff43582","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"PC472","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/marine-accident-investigation-branch","base_path":"/government/organisations/marine-accident-investigation-branch","content_id":"9c66b9a3-1e6a-48e8-974d-2a5635f84679","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-04-18T09:12:26Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Marine Accident Investigation Branch","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"department-for-transport","logo":{"formatted_title":"Marine Accident<br/>Investigation Branch","image":{"url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/organisation/logo/472/MAIB_LOGO.png","alt_text":"Marine Accident Investigation Branch"}}},"links":{}}],"finder":[{"analytics_identifier":null,"api_path":"/api/content/maib-reports","base_path":"/maib-reports","content_id":"33eb214a-9291-49d3-8789-445c1e97b586","description":"Find reports of MAIB investigations into marine accidents and incidents","document_type":"finder","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2017-03-30T10:34:00Z","schema_name":"finder","title":"Marine Accident Investigation Branch reports","withdrawn":false,"details":{"document_noun":"report","filter":{"document_type":"maib_report"},"format_name":"Marine Accident Investigation Branch report","show_summaries":true,"facets":[{"key":"vessel_type","name":"Vessel type","type":"text","preposition":"of type","display_as_result_metadata":true,"filterable":true,"allowed_values":[{"label":"Merchant vessel 100 gross tons or over","value":"merchant-vessel-100-gross-tons-or-over"},{"label":"Merchant vessel under 100 gross tons","value":"merchant-vessel-under-100-gross-tons"},{"label":"Fishing vessel","value":"fishing-vessel"},{"label":"Recreational craft - sail","value":"recreational-craft-sail"},{"label":"Recreational craft - power","value":"recreational-craft-power"}]},{"key":"report_type","name":"Report type","type":"text","preposition":"of type","display_as_result_metadata":true,"filterable":true,"allowed_values":[{"label":"Investigation report","value":"investigation-report"},{"label":"Safety bulletin","value":"safety-bulletin"},{"label":"Completed preliminary examination","value":"completed-preliminary-examination"},{"label":"Overseas report","value":"overseas-report"},{"label":"Discontinued investigation","value":"discontinued-investigation"}]},{"key":"date_of_occurrence","name":"Date of occurrence","short_name":"Occurred","type":"date","preposition":"occurred","display_as_result_metadata":true,"filterable":true}],"default_documents_per_page":50},"links":{}}],"available_translations":[{"title":"Grounding of general cargo vessel Emsland","public_updated_at":null,"analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"maib_report","schema_name":"specialist_document","base_path":"/maib-reports/grounding-of-general-cargo-vessel-emsland-off-montrose-scotland","description":"Location: Departing the Port of Montrose, Scotland.","api_path":"/api/content/maib-reports/grounding-of-general-cargo-vessel-emsland-off-montrose-scotland","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"ae01a87a-3335-459c-88a9-2739eff43582","locale":"en"}]},"format":"placeholder_specialist_document","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"other","government_document_supertype":"other","payload_version":0}
