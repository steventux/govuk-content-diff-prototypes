{"title":"EU Electronic Communications Regulatory Framework 2009: Post Implementation Review","public_updated_at":"2017-04-27T12:01:42Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>This Command Paper provides an overview of the Post Implementation Review (PIR) of the UK’s implementation of revisions to the EU Electronic Communications Framework, which took place in May 2011. The revisions, which were agreed by the EU in 2009, were transposed into UK legislation using four negative resolution statutory instruments:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) 2011</li>\n  <li>The Electronic Communications (Universal Services) Amendment (Order 2011)</li>\n  <li>The Electronic Communications and Wireless Telegraphy Regulations 2011</li>\n  <li>The Communications Act 2003 (Maximum Penalty for Contravention of Information Requirements) Order 2011</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Framework establishes the rules which govern the European telecommunications sector, and is subject to five-yearly reviews of its fitness for purpose.  These reviews include negotiation of updates and revision as necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Negotiations are currently in progress for the latest review, in which the Framework will become known as the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-590-EN-F1-1.PDF\">European Electronic Communications Code</a>. Read <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electronic-communications-framework-review-update\">further information on the UK’s approach and priorities for the review</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This document was originally laid in Parliament in March 2017. It has now been re-laid and published with amendments.</p>\n</div>","change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2017-04-27T13:01:42.000+01:00","note":"First published."}],"documents":["<section class=\"attachment embedded\" id=\"attachment_2075840\">\n  <div class=\"attachment-thumb\">\n      <a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/610586/PIR_EU_Electronic_Communications_Regulatory_Framework_2009.pdf\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/610586/thumbnail_PIR_EU_Electronic_Communications_Regulatory_Framework_2009.pdf.png\" /></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"attachment-details\">\n    <h2 class=\"title\"><a aria-describedby=\"attachment-2075840-accessibility-help\" href=\"/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/610586/PIR_EU_Electronic_Communications_Regulatory_Framework_2009.pdf\">Post Implementation Review of the EU Electronic Communications Regulatory Framework 2009</a></h2>\n    <p class=\"metadata\">\n        <span class=\"references\">\n          Ref: ISBN <span class=\"isbn\">9781474143974</span>, <span class=\"command_paper_number\">Cm 9328</span>\n        </span>\n        <span class=\"type\"><abbr title=\"Portable Document Format\">PDF</abbr></span>, <span class=\"file-size\">411KB</span>, <span class=\"page-length\">19 pages</span>\n    </p>\n      <p>\n        <a class=\"order_url\" title=\"Order a copy of the publication\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications\">Order a copy</a>\n      </p>\n\n\n      <div data-module=\"toggle\" class=\"accessibility-warning\" id=\"attachment-2075840-accessibility-help\">\n        <h2>This file may not be suitable for users of assistive technology.\n          <a class=\"toggler\" href=\"#attachment-2075840-accessibility-request\" data-controls=\"attachment-2075840-accessibility-request\" data-expanded=\"false\">Request an accessible format.</a>\n        </h2>\n        <p id=\"attachment-2075840-accessibility-request\" class=\"js-hidden\">\n          If you use assistive technology (such as a screen reader) and need a\nversion of this document in a more accessible format, please email <a href=\"mailto:enquiries@culture.gov.uk?body=Details%20of%20document%20required%3A%0A%0A%20%20Title%3A%20Post%20Implementation%20Review%20of%20the%20EU%20Electronic%20Communications%20Regulatory%20Framework%202009%0A%20%20Original%20format%3A%20pdf%0A%20%20ISBN%3A%209781474143974%0A%20%20Command%20paper%20number%3A%20Cm%209328%0A%0APlease%20tell%20us%3A%0A%0A%20%201.%20What%20makes%20this%20format%20unsuitable%20for%20you%3F%0A%20%202.%20What%20format%20you%20would%20prefer%3F%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;subject=Request%20for%20%27Post%20Implementation%20Review%20of%20the%20EU%20Electronic%20Communications%20Regulatory%20Framework%202009%27%20in%20an%20alternative%20format\">enquiries@culture.gov.uk</a>.\nPlease tell us what format you need.
