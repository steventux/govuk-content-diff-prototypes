{"title":"Mental health problems are everyone’s problem: article by Theresa May","public_updated_at":"2017-01-09T11:20:40Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>It is a tragic fact that 1 in 10 children in this country has a diagnosable mental health condition.</p>\n\n<p>The long-term effects can be crippling: children with behavioural disorders are 4 times more likely to be dependent on drugs, 6 times more likely to die before the age of 30, and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.</p>\n\n<p>While this government legislated for ‘parity of esteem’ in healthcare – so that whatever your illness, physical or mental, you are treated the same – very often the treatment for those with mental illnesses is inadequate.</p>\n\n<p>For years it has fallen to civil society, charities, and the media to take on the problem – and I applaud all the work that the Huffington Post has done to raise awareness through its <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://projects.huffingtonpost.co.uk/young-minds-matter/\">Young Minds Matter</a> series.</p>\n\n<p>But it is time for government to do more – to join HuffPost and other campaigners in the fight against something that blights so many young lives.</p>\n\n<p>The need is urgent: the number of girls saying they’ve self-harmed has more than trebled in recent years, as just 1 example.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why I raised mental health during my <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-from-the-new-prime-minister-theresa-may\">speech when I arrived at Downing Street for the first time as Prime Minister</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And it’s why today I’m <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-unveils-plans-to-transform-mental-health-support\">announcing a step-change</a> in the way that we deal with these issues.</p>\n\n<p>I want to see mental health addressed not just in our hospitals, but in our classrooms and communities.</p>\n\n<p>I want to see the stigma stripped away so that no-one in this country feels unable to talk about what they’re going through or seek help.</p>\n\n<p>I want to see a focus on prevention as well as treatment, especially since so many adult mental health problems – which 1 in 4 of us will suffer from at any one time – begin in childhood.</p>\n\n<p>This is part of a wider approach to tackle the burning injustices we face in society, and to build a stronger, fairer Britain that works for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>For no parent should feel helpless when watching their child suffer. No teacher should feel ill-equipped to deal with a troubled pupil. No teenager should have to leave their local area to seek treatment. No child should ever be left to feel like their life is not worth living.</p>\n\n<p>Mental health problems are everyone’s problem. As a society we must face up to that fact. And the announcements I am making today will ensure we do just that.</p>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p>Find out more: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-unveils-plans-to-transform-mental-health-support\">Prime Minister unveils plans to transform mental health support</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>","political":true,"delivered_on":"2016-01-11T09:30:00+00:00","change_history":[{"public_timestamp":"2017-01-09T11:20:40.000+00:00","note":"First published."}],"image":{"alt_text":"The Rt Hon Theresa May MP","url":"/government/uploads/system/uploads/person/image/6/PM_portrait_960x640.jpg"},"government":{"title":"2015 Conservative government","slug":"2015-conservative-government","current":true},"first_public_at":"2017-01-09T11:20:40.000+00:00"},"routes":[{"path":"/government/speeches/mental-health-problems-are-everyones-problem-article-by-theresa-may","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"government-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"authored_article","schema_name":"speech","first_published_at":"2017-01-09T11:20:40Z","base_path":"/government/speeches/mental-health-problems-are-everyones-problem-article-by-theresa-may","description":"The Prime Minister wrote for the Huffington Post about a new approach to mental health support.
