{"title":"Fire statistics data tables","public_updated_at":"2016-10-27T08:30:22Z","details":{"body":"<div class=\"govspeak\"><p>This information covers fires, false and other incidents attended by firecrews, and the statistics include the numbers of incidents, fires, fatalities and casualties as well as information on response times to fires. The Home Office also collect information on the workforce, fire prevention work, health and safety and firefighter pensions. All data tables on fire statistics are below.</p>\n\n<p>The Home Office has responsibility for fire services in England. The vast majority of data tables produced by the Home Office are for England but some (0101, 0103, 0201, 0501, 1401) tables are for Great Britain split by nation. In the past the Department for Communities and Local Government (who previously had responsibility for fire services in England) produced data tables for Great Britain and at times the UK.
