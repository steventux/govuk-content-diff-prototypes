This includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>news</li>\n  <li>publications</li>\n  <li>web content</li>\n  <li>consultations</li>\n  <li>speeches</li>\n  <li>publicity campaigns</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"confidentiality-and-security\">Confidentiality and Security</h3>\n\n<p>We strongly recommend that you not discuss the details of your financial affairs on Twitter, or give out your personal financial details.</p>\n\n<p>We cannot discuss the affairs of individuals, and we cannot accept tweets as notification in respect of your dealings with us.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"replies-and-direct-messages\">Replies and Direct Messages</h3>\n\n<p>We welcome feedback and ideas from our followers and will endeavour to add value to conversations where we can.</p>\n\n<p>We will read all tweets directed to us, and will pass any emerging themes or helpful suggestions to the relevant people in the VOA. However, due to resource constraints we will not always be able to reply individually to all the messages we receive via Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>In general we prefer not to send or receive Direct Messages, to keep conversations open and public.</p>\n\n<p>We are bound by the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code\">Civil Service Code</a>, and cannot engage on issues of party politics.</p>\n\n<p>You can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/contact-finder\">contact the VOA</a> for official correspondence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"following\">Following</h3>\n\n<p>If you follow us, we will not automatically follow you back. This avoids us having to spend time dealing with spam accounts, and helps keep discussions open by limiting the use of Direct Messages.</p>\n\n<p>Our following of a Twitter account does not imply endorsement of any kind by the VOA.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"availability\">Availability</h3>\n\n<p>We will generally update and monitor our Twitter account during office hours only, Monday to Friday.</p>\n\n<p>Twitter may occasionally become unavailable. The VOA accepts no responsibility for lack of service due to Twitter downtime.</p>\n</div>","organisation":"ae98edb5-87b4-4a69-a31a-e0e5298f949d","tags":{"browse_pages":[],"policies":[],"topics":[]}},"routes":[{"path":"/government/organisations/valuation-office-agency/about/social-media-use","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"whitehall","rendering_app":"whitehall-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"social_media_use","schema_name":"corporate_information_page","first_published_at":"2016-06-27T09:30:05Z","base_path":"/government/organisations/valuation-office-agency/about/social-media-use","description":"Why and how the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) uses social media and what you can expect from us.","content_id":"13c66fc9-6031-4d14-a1ba-26fa44f69c65","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"EA87","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/valuation-office-agency","base_path":"/government/organisations/valuation-office-agency","content_id":"ae98edb5-87b4-4a69-a31a-e0e5298f949d","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2014-12-01T10:49:55Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"Valuation Office Agency","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"hm-revenue-customs","logo":{"formatted_title":"Valuation Office Agency","crest":"single-identity"}},"links":{}}],"available_translations":[{"title":"Social media use","public_updated_at":"2016-06-27T09:30:01Z","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"social_media_use","schema_name":"corporate_information_page","base_path":"/government/organisations/valuation-office-agency/about/social-media-use","description":"Why and how the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) uses social media and what you can expect from us.","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/valuation-office-agency/about/social-media-use","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"13c66fc9-6031-4d14-a1ba-26fa44f69c65","locale":"en"}]},"format":"corporate_information_page","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"other","government_document_supertype":"other","payload_version":0}
