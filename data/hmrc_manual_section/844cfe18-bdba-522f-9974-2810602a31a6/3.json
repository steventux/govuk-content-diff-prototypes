This may require a good deal of research. In particular, it is important not be misled by labels. You should consider all of the surrounding circumstances. You should examine the formal documentation such as contracts and any correspondence between the parties and their representatives. This may however, not tell the whole story and, where appropriate, you should request a meeting with those who sought or negotiated the compensation should in order to establish whether the documentation fully reflects what happened. It may also be useful to liaise with the payerâ€™s office.</p>\n\n<p>As regards the treatment of compensation payments to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>farmers for disturbance or for compulsory acquisition of land, etc (see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim55220\">BIM55220</a> - <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim55240\">BIM55240</a>)</li>\n  <li>licensee tenants of public houses on loss of tenancy (see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-gains-manual/cg72450p\">CG72450</a> onwards)</li>\n  <li>a person who has made an election to compute the profits of their trade on the cash basis, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim70020\">BIM70020</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For compensation payments that take the form of Government etc grants, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim40450\">BIM40450</a> onwards.</p>\n","section_id":"BIM40101","breadcrumbs":[{"section_id":"BIM40000","base_path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim40000"},{"section_id":"BIM40099","base_path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim40099"},{"section_id":"BIM40100","base_path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim40100"}],"child_section_groups":[],"manual":{"base_path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual"}},"routes":[{"path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim40101","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"hmrc-manuals-api","rendering_app":"manuals-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"hmrc_manual_section","schema_name":"hmrc_manual_section","first_published_at":"2016-02-29T09:24:10Z","base_path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim40101","description":"","content_id":"844cfe18-bdba-522f-9974-2810602a31a6","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"D25","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs","base_path":"/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs","content_id":"6667cce2-e809-4e21-ae09-cb0bdc1ddda3","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-05-13T10:09:06Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"HM Revenue & Customs","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"hm-revenue-customs","logo":{"formatted_title":"HM Revenue<br/>&amp; Customs","crest":"hmrc"}},"links":{}}],"available_translations":[{"title":"Specific receipts: compensation and damages: introduction","public_updated_at":"2016-04-01T14:13:15Z","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"hmrc_manual_section","schema_name":"hmrc_manual_section","base_path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim40101","description":"","api_path":"/api/content/hmrc-internal-manuals/business-income-manual/bim40101","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"844cfe18-bdba-522f-9974-2810602a31a6","locale":"en"}]},"format":"hmrc_manual_section","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"other","government_document_supertype":"other","payload_version":0}
