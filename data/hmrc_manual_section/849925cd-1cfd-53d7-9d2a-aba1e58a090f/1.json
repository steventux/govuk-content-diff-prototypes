This view will not necessarily agree with the position being presented by either the employer or worker. It is important to remember that whilst HM Revenue &amp; Customs uses complaints as a source for investigation, it is not its role to merely represent a complaint and/or the views of a worker. A NMW Officer is expected to reach their own, impartial view (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-minimum-wage-manual/nmwm12150\">NMWM12150</a>). If workers wish to pursue their own view of arrangements or legislation they can take their own legal action should they choose, but if they do so HM Revenue &amp; Customs cannot also take action on their behalf (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-minimum-wage-manual/nmwm13020\">NMWM13020</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The evidence obtained will vary from investigation to investigation but is likely to involve information gathered from employers and workers as well as consideration of employer records (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-minimum-wage-manual/nmwm12060\">NMWM12060</a>) and information from relevant third parties, such as service users, training providers, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Where evidence is contradictory, inconsistent or lacking it is likely that the NMW Officer will need to test, challenge and seek corroboration of the information being provided in order to form a fully considered view (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-minimum-wage-manual/nmwm12150\">NMWM12150</a>) using their best judgment (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-minimum-wage-manual/nmwm12170\">NMWM12170</a>) where appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>If there is insufficient evidence available for a NMW Officer to form a view regarding whether an employer has paid a worker at least national minimum wage then it will not be appropriate to consider any enforcement action, for example;</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>there may be insufficient evidence that a person is a worker for national minimum wage purposes because they are self-employed or a volunteer, or</li>\n  <li>it is not possible to issue a notice of underpayment (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-minimum-wage-manual/nmwm13030\">NMWM13030</a>) where an employer has not been correctly identified.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>NMW Officers have legal powers (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-minimum-wage-manual/nmwm12210\">NMWM12210</a>) to enable them to conduct investigations and there are a range of criminal offences (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-minimum-wage-manual/nmwm12250\">NMWM12250</a>) which can be used to ensure that the payment of national minimum wage and the role of the NMW Officer are taken seriously.</p>\n","section_id":"NMWM12010","breadcrumbs":[{"section_id":"NMWM12000","base_path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-minimum-wage-manual/nmwm12000"}],"child_section_groups":[],"manual":{"base_path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-minimum-wage-manual"}},"routes":[{"path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-minimum-wage-manual/nmwm12010","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"hmrc-manuals-api","rendering_app":"manuals-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"hmrc_manual_section","schema_name":"hmrc_manual_section","first_published_at":"2016-04-16T07:06:36Z","base_path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-minimum-wage-manual/nmwm12010","description":"","content_id":"849925cd-1cfd-53d7-9d2a-aba1e58a090f","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"D25","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs","base_path":"/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs","content_id":"6667cce2-e809-4e21-ae09-cb0bdc1ddda3","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-05-13T10:09:06Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"HM Revenue & Customs","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"hm-revenue-customs","logo":{"formatted_title":"HM Revenue<br/>&amp; Customs","crest":"hmrc"}},"links":{}}],"available_translations":[{"title":"Records, Evidence, Powers & Offences: Introduction","public_updated_at":"2016-02-17T13:59:57Z","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"hmrc_manual_section","schema_name":"hmrc_manual_section","base_path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-minimum-wage-manual/nmwm12010","description":"","api_path":"/api/content/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-minimum-wage-manual/nmwm12010","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"849925cd-1cfd-53d7-9d2a-aba1e58a090f","locale":"en"}]},"format":"hmrc_manual_section","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"other","government_document_supertype":"other","payload_version":0}
