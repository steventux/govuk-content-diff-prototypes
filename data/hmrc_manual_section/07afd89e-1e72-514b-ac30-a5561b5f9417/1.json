However, some goods are supplied separately, either because the link to “care” is too tenuous, or because they are not supplied to the person receiving the care at all. For example, the supply of meals to hospital patients is exempt, but not meals to staff or visitors.</p>\n","section_id":"VATHLT3080","breadcrumbs":[{"section_id":"VATHLT3000","base_path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/vat-health/vathlt3000"},{"section_id":"VATHLT3070","base_path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/vat-health/vathlt3070"}],"child_section_groups":[],"manual":{"base_path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/vat-health"}},"routes":[{"path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/vat-health/vathlt3080","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"hmrc-manuals-api","rendering_app":"manuals-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"hmrc_manual_section","schema_name":"hmrc_manual_section","first_published_at":"2016-05-20T22:25:55Z","base_path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/vat-health/vathlt3080","description":"","content_id":"07afd89e-1e72-514b-ac30-a5561b5f9417","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"D25","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs","base_path":"/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs","content_id":"6667cce2-e809-4e21-ae09-cb0bdc1ddda3","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-05-13T10:09:06Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"HM Revenue & Customs","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"hm-revenue-customs","logo":{"formatted_title":"HM Revenue<br/>&amp; Customs","crest":"hmrc"}},"links":{}}],"available_translations":[{"title":"Have goods been supplied in connection with care or medical or surgical treatment?
