Any profits arising from such a period would continue to be included in the ‘relevant shipping profits’ (see ) in the normal way.</p>\n\n<p>The basic rule in FA00/SCH22/PARA22 is that one or more periods of non-qualifying use in a 12-month accounting period are to be disregarded, if the aggregate period of non-qualifying use is no more than 30 days in that accounting period.</p>\n\n<p>But, If the accounting period is less than 12 months (paragraph 22(3)), or if the ship is operated for only part of the accounting period (paragraph 22(4)), then the 30-day period must be reduced proportionately.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"scope-of-fa00sch22para22\">Scope of FA00/SCH22/PARA22</h2>\n\n<p>The provisions of PARA22 apply specifically when a ship would otherwise be non-qualifying because it was temporarily being used as one of the excluded types listed in PARA20.</p>\n\n<p>The same approach applies when a ship would otherwise be non-qualifying because it was (temporarily) not being used for one of the activities listed in PARA19 (1)(a) – (d).</p>\n\n<p>See examples of this in .</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>FA00/SCH22/PARA22 (effect of change of use)</td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td> </td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>FA05/SCH7/PARA7  (effect of change of use)</td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p> </p>\n","section_id":"TTM03710","breadcrumbs":[{"section_id":"TTM03000","base_path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/tonnage-tax-manual/ttm03000"}],"child_section_groups":[],"manual":{"base_path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/tonnage-tax-manual"}},"routes":[{"path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/tonnage-tax-manual/ttm03710","type":"exact"}],"redirects":[],"publishing_app":"hmrc-manuals-api","rendering_app":"manuals-frontend","need_ids":[],"phase":"live","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"hmrc_manual_section","schema_name":"hmrc_manual_section","first_published_at":"2016-03-19T19:25:53Z","base_path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/tonnage-tax-manual/ttm03710","description":"","content_id":"c0b72751-fa04-56c3-822b-43aed6560c15","locale":"en","expanded_links":{"organisations":[{"analytics_identifier":"D25","api_path":"/api/content/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs","base_path":"/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs","content_id":"6667cce2-e809-4e21-ae09-cb0bdc1ddda3","description":null,"document_type":"organisation","locale":"en","public_updated_at":"2015-05-13T10:09:06Z","schema_name":"placeholder","title":"HM Revenue & Customs","withdrawn":false,"details":{"brand":"hm-revenue-customs","logo":{"formatted_title":"HM Revenue<br/>&amp; Customs","crest":"hmrc"}},"links":{}}],"available_translations":[{"title":"Qualifying companies and ships: Temporary change of use","public_updated_at":"2016-03-16T10:28:53Z","analytics_identifier":null,"document_type":"hmrc_manual_section","schema_name":"hmrc_manual_section","base_path":"/hmrc-internal-manuals/tonnage-tax-manual/ttm03710","description":"","api_path":"/api/content/hmrc-internal-manuals/tonnage-tax-manual/ttm03710","withdrawn":false,"content_id":"c0b72751-fa04-56c3-822b-43aed6560c15","locale":"en"}]},"format":"hmrc_manual_section","navigation_document_supertype":"other","user_journey_document_supertype":"thing","email_document_supertype":"other","government_document_supertype":"other","payload_version":0}
